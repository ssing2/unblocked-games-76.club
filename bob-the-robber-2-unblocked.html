                    <h4 class="mb-3">How to Play</h4>
                    <p>Bob The Robber 2 has straightforward controls that are easy to learn:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Move:</strong> Use the arrow keys or WASD to move Bob left and right</li>
                        <li><strong>Jump:</strong> Press Up Arrow, W, or Spacebar to jump</li>
                        <li><strong>Crouch:</strong> Press Down Arrow or S to crouch under obstacles</li>
                        <li><strong>Interact:</strong> Press X or E to interact with objects (pick locks, disable cameras, open doors)</li>
                        <li><strong>Hide:</strong> Stand in shadows to become nearly invisible to guards</li>
                        <li><strong>Knock Out:</strong> Approach a guard from behind and press X or E to temporarily knock them out</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The goal in each level is to find and steal all the valuable items, then locate and escape through the exit door. Be careful not to be seen by guards or caught by security cameras! If you're spotted, you'll need to restart the level.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master the Art of Shadow Hiding</h5>
                        <p>The most important skill in Bob The Robber 2 is knowing how to use shadows effectively. When Bob stands in a shadowy area, he becomes nearly invisible to guards – even if they're looking right at him! Look for darker areas in each level and use them as safe zones for planning your next move. The trick is to time your movements between shadows carefully. Wait until guards turn away or reach the furthest point in their patrol route before dashing to the next shadow. Remember that some advanced guards have flashlights that can reveal you even in shadows, so always note which type of guard you're dealing with. Pro tip: in levels with light switches, turning them off creates more shadows throughout the entire room!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Learn the Guard Patrol Patterns</h5>
                        <p>Every guard in the game follows a specific patrol pattern that you can learn and exploit. Take time to observe each guard's movement before making your move. Some guards walk back and forth along a fixed path, while others might turn around randomly or stop to look in different directions. The key to success is patience – watch a guard complete their entire patrol cycle at least once before attempting to sneak past them. Look for the moment when their back is turned or when they're furthest from your intended path. Remember that knocked-out guards will eventually wake up, so time your movements accordingly. For maximum efficiency, try to memorize the patterns of multiple guards at once to find the perfect window of opportunity.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Prioritize Security System Disabling</h5>
                        <p>When entering a new area, your first priority should be identifying and disabling security systems. Cameras and laser beams can instantly alert guards if you're spotted, so deal with them before attempting to steal anything. Security cameras typically have a control panel nearby – look for a small box on the wall that you can interact with. Laser beams often have similar disable switches. In some levels, you'll find the main security room which allows you to shut down multiple systems at once – these should be your first target! Keep in mind that some security systems will reactivate after a short time, so move quickly after disabling them. Advanced players often map out the entire security system of a level before making their first move.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Perfect Your Lock Picking Technique</h5>
                        <p>Lock picking is a crucial skill that you'll use constantly throughout the game. When you interact with a locked door or safe, a mini-game appears where you need to align the pick with the correct position. The trick to mastering this is watching for the subtle visual cue when your pick aligns with the sweet spot – the lock will wiggle slightly different when you're in the right position. Don't rush this process, as failed attempts make noise that can alert nearby guards. As you progress, you'll encounter more complex locks that require multiple successful picks in a row. For these advanced locks, try to develop muscle memory for the general position of each pin. Some players find it helpful to count the clicks as they move the pick to better remember the correct positions.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Use Environmental Distractions</h5>
                        <p>The environment can be your best ally if you know how to use it. Some levels contain objects that can be interacted with to create distractions – things like radios that can be turned on, objects that can be knocked over, or machinery that can be activated. These distractions will cause guards to investigate the source of the noise, temporarily pulling them away from their patrol routes. This creates perfect opportunities to slip past or access areas that were previously guarded. The key is timing your distraction properly and knowing exactly where you'll go during the brief window it creates. Remember that guards will return to their normal patrol after investigating, so don't linger too long in their territory!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Optimize Your Loot Collection Route</h5>
                        <p>Planning an efficient route through each level can save you from unnecessary risks. Before grabbing any loot, take time to survey the entire level and mentally map out where all the valuable items are located. Then plan a route that allows you to collect everything while minimizing exposure to guards and security systems. Sometimes it's better to leave certain items for later rather than taking dangerous paths prematurely. The most valuable items are often protected by the toughest security, so consider saving these for last when you've already secured an escape route. Remember that in most levels, you need to collect all critical loot before the exit will unlock. Becoming an expert at route planning is what separates amateur thieves from master heist planners!</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Residential Homes</h5>
                        <p>The earlier levels typically take place in residential buildings with relatively simple security. These homes might have basic alarm systems, a few patrolling guards, and straightforward layouts. They're perfect for learning the core mechanics of the game without overwhelming pressure. Focus on mastering the fundamentals here: shadow hiding, basic lock picking, and timing your movements between guard patrols. The loot in these levels is usually easy to find – look for jewelry boxes, wall safes, and cash stashes. While these levels might seem easy, try to complete them without being spotted at all to develop good stealth habits that will be essential later. Think of these as your training grounds before the real challenges begin.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Corporate Offices</h5>
                        <p>As you progress, you'll break into corporate buildings with more sophisticated security. These levels feature security cameras with overlapping fields of vision, more guards with coordinated patrol patterns, and electronic door locks requiring keycards. The layouts become more maze-like, with multiple floors connected by stairs and elevators. Focus on finding the security room early, as disabling the main systems can make the rest of the heist much easier. The most valuable loot in these levels is often stored in executive offices or server rooms, which typically have the tightest security. These levels test your ability to plan multi-stage approaches, where you might need to secure a keycard from one area before accessing another. Patience becomes even more important here – rushing will almost certainly trigger alarms.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Banks and High-Security Facilities</h5>
                        <p>The most challenging levels take place in banks and other high-security locations featuring cutting-edge protection systems. Expect to encounter laser grids, motion detectors, guards with flashlights that can spot you in shadows, and time-locked vaults. These levels often require precise timing and perfect execution of complex sequences. You'll need to use every trick in your arsenal, from creating distractions to temporarily knocking out guards. The path to the main vault or secure area usually involves multiple security layers that must be disabled in the correct order. These levels are designed to test experienced players and might require multiple attempts to complete. The reward for these difficult heists is substantial, though – the most valuable treasures in the game are hidden behind the toughest security systems.</p>

                        <h5>Special Challenge Levels</h5>
                        <p>Some versions of Bob The Robber 2 include special challenge levels that break from the standard formula. These might include time-limited heists where you must escape before a timer runs out, completely darkened buildings where you rely on limited visibility, or levels with special conditions like "no knockouts allowed." These challenges are designed for players who have mastered the basic game and want to test their skills in extreme conditions. The rewards for completing these special levels often include unique items or unlockable content. Don't get frustrated if these seem impossible at first – they're deliberately designed to push your stealth skills to the limit and might require dozens of attempts before you succeed.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I get past the guard in level 3 who never moves?</h5>
                        <p>That stationary guard in level 3 is one of the first major challenges! Unlike patrolling guards, this one stands in one spot constantly watching a critical pathway. There are three approaches that work: First, check if there's an alternative route – sometimes there's a vent or another door that bypasses the guard entirely. Second, look for an environmental distraction you can trigger from a safe distance – there's often a radio or breakable object nearby that will draw the guard away temporarily. Third, if you've unlocked the knockout ability, you can approach the guard from behind by using the shadows along the walls. Remember that you need to be directly behind them for the knockout option to appear. If all else fails, timing is key – even stationary guards occasionally look away or check their phones, creating a brief window to sneak past if you're quick!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Why can't I pick certain locks in the game?</h5>
                        <p>If you're unable to interact with certain locks, there are a few possible reasons: First, you might not have unlocked the appropriate lock picking skill level yet – some locks require advanced picking abilities that are unlocked as you progress through the game. Second, some doors require keycards or special keys rather than being pickable – look around for a guard carrying a keycard or a key hidden somewhere in the level. Third, certain doors only open after you've collected all the required loot or triggered a specific event elsewhere in the level. Finally, make sure you're approaching the lock from the correct position – Bob needs to be standing directly in front of the door for the interaction prompt to appear. If you're still stuck, try exploring other areas first, as the solution might involve completing another objective before that lock becomes accessible.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I deal with security cameras effectively?</h5>
                        <p>Security cameras are tricky obstacles that require careful handling! The most reliable approach is to find and disable their control panel, which is usually mounted on a nearby wall – look for a small box with blinking lights that you can interact with. If you can't find or reach the control panel, you'll need to time your movements to pass when the camera is pointing away. Most cameras sweep back and forth in a predictable pattern, so watch a full cycle before moving. Remember that cameras have a cone of vision – the area they can "see" extends outward in a triangle shape. The edges of this cone are less sensitive than the center, so sometimes you can carefully sneak along the very edge of their vision. In later levels, you might unlock an EMP device that can temporarily disable electronics, including cameras. As a last resort, in some levels, you can find the security room which allows you to shut down all cameras at once.</p>

                        <h5>What's the best way to spend the coins I collect?</h5>
                        <p>Spending your hard-earned coins wisely can make a huge difference in gameplay! Focus first on upgrading your lock picking ability, as this is used constantly throughout the game and higher levels have increasingly complex locks. Your second priority should be the "Shadow Move" upgrade, which allows you to move faster while staying in shadows – this is incredibly useful for navigating between safe spots without being detected. The "Knockout Duration" upgrade is also extremely valuable, as it keeps guards unconscious longer, giving you more time to work. Items like "Night Vision" and "EMP Device" are situationally useful but not essential for every level. If you're finding the game particularly difficult, the "Radar" upgrade can help by showing guard positions on your mini-map. Save the purely cosmetic upgrades for last, after you've purchased all the functional improvements that help you complete heists more effectively.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Does the game save my progress automatically?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! Bob The Robber 2 automatically saves your progress as you complete levels, collect coins, and purchase upgrades. The game uses your browser's local storage, so you can close the game and return later to continue from where you left off. Your unlocked levels, collected items, and purchased skills will all be saved. However, if you're playing on a school or public computer, be aware that your progress might be reset if the browser data is cleared between sessions. For the most reliable experience, try to complete world sets in one sitting when using shared computers. If you're really invested in your progress, consider playing on a personal device where your data won't be cleared. Some versions of the game might also offer manual save options or account-based saves, though this varies between implementations. Remember that progress within an individual level is not saved – if you exit mid-heist, you'll need to restart that specific level from the beginning.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Bob The Robber 2 Is So Addictive</h4>
                    <p>Bob The Robber 2 has mastered the perfect formula for an addictive stealth game that keeps players coming back for "just one more heist." The core gameplay loop provides a satisfying risk-reward experience – the tension of nearly getting caught followed by the triumph of successfully sneaking past a guard delivers a genuine adrenaline rush that's hard to resist. This emotional rollercoaster of tension and relief creates a compelling experience that feels rewarding on a psychological level.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game's level design brilliantly increases in complexity at just the right pace. Early levels build confidence by introducing mechanics one at a time, while later challenges combine these elements in increasingly creative ways. This gradual progression keeps you in the "flow zone" – that sweet spot between boredom and frustration where you're constantly challenged but never overwhelmed. Each new level presents a unique puzzle that requires a slightly different approach, preventing the gameplay from ever feeling repetitive.</p>
                    
                    <p>The upgrade system provides a powerful motivation to continue playing. With each successful heist, you earn coins that can be spent on new abilities and tools, creating a rewarding progression loop. These upgrades aren't just cosmetic – they meaningfully change how you can approach levels, opening up new strategies and techniques. The satisfaction of returning to a previously difficult level with your newly upgraded skills and breezing through it creates a tangible sense of improvement that keeps you engaged.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Bob The Robber 2 respects the player's intelligence by not holding your hand too much. While the core mechanics are easy to learn, mastering the perfect heist requires observation, planning, and strategic thinking. When you successfully complete a difficult level, the victory feels earned through your own skill rather than handed to you. This sense of accomplishment is what transforms a simple game into an addictive experience that has players sneaking and stealing through "just one more level" until they suddenly realize they've been playing for hours!</p>
