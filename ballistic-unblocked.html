                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Combat Tactics</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master Movement and Positioning</h5>
                        <p>In Ballistic, standing still is a death sentence! Keep moving constantly to make yourself a harder target to hit. Learn to strafe (moving side to side while shooting) and use jump shots to throw off enemy aim. Good positioning is crucial – try to maintain the high ground whenever possible, use cover effectively, and avoid open areas where you can be easily targeted from multiple angles. Be unpredictable in your movement patterns and always have an escape route planned.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Know Your Weapons</h5>
                        <p>Each weapon in Ballistic has unique characteristics – understanding these is key to dominating matches. Assault rifles are versatile for medium-range combat, SMGs excel in close quarters, shotguns are devastating up close but useless at range, and sniper rifles can one-shot enemies from a distance but require precision. Experiment with different weapons to find what suits your playstyle, but also be adaptable – sometimes switching to a shotgun for indoor areas or a sniper for open maps can give you a significant advantage.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Control Your Recoil</h5>
                        <p>Spray-and-pray rarely works against skilled opponents. Learn each weapon's recoil pattern and practice controlling it by slightly pulling down on your mouse as you fire. For weapons with heavy recoil, firing in short bursts (3-5 bullets) will significantly improve your accuracy. When using automatic weapons at longer ranges, tap-firing (quick single shots) is often more effective than holding down the trigger. Taking that extra split second to aim properly before firing will result in more kills than spraying wildly.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Use Sound to Your Advantage</h5>
                        <p>Audio cues are incredibly valuable in Ballistic. If possible, play with headphones to hear enemy footsteps, reloads, and gunfire directionally. This gives you critical information about enemy positions without having to see them. Be conscious of the noise you make too – sprinting makes you faster but also louder, potentially giving away your position. When you're trying to flank or surprise enemies, consider walking instead of running to stay quieter.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Practice Pre-Aiming and Pre-Firing</h5>
                        <p>Top players always have their crosshairs positioned where enemies are likely to appear, not at the floor or sky. This technique, called "pre-aiming," means you'll need minimal adjustment when an enemy does show up. In high-traffic areas or when you hear an enemy approaching, try "pre-firing" – shooting slightly before you see them as you peek around a corner. This technique can catch opponents off guard and give you a crucial split-second advantage in firefights.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Play the Objective in Team Modes</h5>
                        <p>While racking up kills is fun, winning team modes often requires playing the objective. Coordinate with teammates, call out enemy positions if possible, and focus on the goal of the specific game mode you're playing. In Team Deathmatch, staying with teammates creates crossfire situations that are difficult for enemies to handle. Remember that a player who goes 10-5 while defending objectives is usually more valuable than someone who goes 20-15 but ignores the objective completely.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Urban District</h5>
                        <p>This city-themed map features a mix of indoor and outdoor areas with plenty of cover. The central plaza is a high-traffic area with multiple entry points – it offers quick engagements but leaves you vulnerable from several angles. For a more strategic approach, try controlling the second-floor windows overlooking the plaza, which provide excellent sightlines while offering decent cover. The underground passage is perfect for flanking maneuvers but watch for campers at either exit. SMGs and assault rifles work best in this balanced environment.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Warehouse Complex</h5>
                        <p>This close-quarters map is dominated by tight corridors and storage areas with stacked crates. Shotguns and SMGs reign supreme here due to the short engagement distances. The elevated office area provides a good overview of the main floor but has limited escape routes – use it carefully and don't stay in one spot too long. The loading dock area features longer sightlines suitable for assault rifles. Be especially aware of your surroundings in this map, as enemies can appear from numerous angles and hiding spots.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Desert Outpost</h5>
                        <p>This open map features long sightlines and minimal cover, making it a sniper's paradise. If sniping isn't your style, learn to use the scattered buildings and rock formations for cover as you move between areas. The central watchtower provides an excellent vantage point but also makes you an obvious target – don't linger too long. The underground bunker offers shelter from snipers but creates intense close-quarters battles. Consider carrying a sniper rifle or assault rifle as your primary and an SMG as your secondary to handle different engagement ranges.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Cargo Ship</h5>
                        <p>This multi-level map features narrow corridors and staircases connecting different decks of a massive cargo vessel. Vertical gameplay is crucial here – controlling the upper decks gives you a significant advantage. The engine room provides intense close-quarters combat opportunities, while the open deck areas allow for medium-range engagements. Learn the locations of the staircases and ladders for quick navigation between levels. The confined spaces make grenades particularly effective for clearing rooms before entering.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Does Ballistic have different game modes?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! Ballistic features several game modes to keep the action fresh. The main modes include Team Deathmatch (work with your team to outscore the enemy), Free-for-All (every player for themselves), and sometimes special event modes depending on the version you're playing. Each mode offers a different gameplay experience, so try them all to find your favorite. Team modes generally reward coordination and objective play, while Free-for-All is all about individual skill and quick reflexes.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I unlock new weapons and upgrades?</h5>
                        <p>As you play matches in Ballistic, you'll earn experience points (XP) and in-game currency based on your performance. Gaining enough XP will increase your level, which unlocks new weapons and equipment options. The currency you earn can be spent in the loadout menu to purchase these unlocked items or upgrade existing ones. Focus on mastering a few weapons rather than buying everything – it's better to have a fully upgraded assault rifle than several basic weapons. Playing daily and completing any available challenges can significantly speed up your progression.</p>

                        <h5>Why is my game lagging or running slowly?</h5>
                        <p>Since Ballistic is a browser-based game with relatively advanced graphics, you might experience performance issues on older computers or with slow internet connections. To improve performance, try: lowering the graphics settings in the options menu; closing other browser tabs and applications; using a wired internet connection instead of Wi-Fi if possible; making sure your browser is updated to the latest version; clearing your browser cache; or trying a different browser (Chrome and Firefox typically perform best for browser games). If you're playing at school, be aware that network restrictions might affect performance.</p>

                        <h5>Can I play Ballistic with my friends?</h5>
                        <p>Most versions of Ballistic allow you to play with friends, though the exact method varies. Look for a "Create Party" or "Join Game" option in the main menu. You might need to share a room code or link with friends to have them join your game. Some versions also allow you to join the same public server by selecting it from the server list. If you're playing at school, be aware that some network restrictions might prevent multiplayer functionality, in which case you might be limited to playing against AI opponents or random online players.</p>

                        <h5>Is my progress saved automatically?</h5>
                        <p>Yes, Ballistic typically saves your progress automatically using your browser's local storage or an account system if you've registered. Your level, unlocked items, and stats should be preserved between gaming sessions as long as you're using the same browser and haven't cleared your browsing data. For the most reliable experience, some versions offer account creation which ensures your progress is saved server-side. If you're playing at school, be aware that computers might clear browser data between sessions, so your progress could be reset.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Ballistic Is So Addictive</h4>
                    <p>Ballistic has mastered the formula for creating an incredibly addictive FPS experience that keeps players coming back for "just one more match." The quick gameplay loop is perfectly designed for those moments between classes or during lunch breaks – matches are short enough to fit into limited free time but intense enough to deliver that adrenaline rush shooters are known for.</p>
                    
                    <p>The progression system hits that sweet spot of always giving you something to work toward. Whether it's unlocking that next weapon, earning enough currency for an upgrade, or just trying to beat your personal best score, there's always a goal just within reach. This creates that "carrot on a stick" effect that makes it hard to stop playing when you're "so close" to your next reward.</p>
                    
                    <p>The variety of maps and game modes ensures the experience stays fresh even after hours of play. Each map requires different strategies and weapon selections, forcing you to adapt rather than rely on a single approach. This variety challenges players to develop multiple skills rather than mastering just one playstyle, adding substantial depth to what might otherwise be a simple shooter.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Ballistic delivers the satisfaction of improvement. As you play more, you'll notice your aim getting sharper, your movement becoming more fluid, and your game sense developing. Those moments when you pull off a perfect flank or hit an impossible headshot deliver a dopamine hit that few other gaming experiences can match. The visible progression in both your character's arsenal and your own skills creates a powerful feedback loop that keeps you engaged match after match.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Best Loadouts for Different Playstyles</h4>
                    <p>Customize your gear to match how you play:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Rusher:</strong> Equip an SMG with extended magazines and laser sight for improved hip-fire accuracy. Choose lightweight armor for faster movement speed and stun grenades to disorient enemies before charging in. This loadout is perfect for players who prefer constant movement and close-quarters combat.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Tactical Player:</strong> An assault rifle with a red dot sight and foregrip for reduced recoil gives you versatility at multiple ranges. Medium armor balances protection and mobility, while frag grenades help clear rooms before entering. This balanced loadout works well for methodical players who like to control the flow of combat.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Support:</strong> LMGs with extended barrels and bipods excel at holding areas and providing covering fire. Heavy armor absorbs more damage at the cost of speed, while smoke grenades create cover for teammates. This setup is ideal for players who prefer defending objectives rather than aggressive pushing.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Sharpshooter:</strong> Sniper rifles with variable zoom scopes and stabilizing stocks reward precision and patience. Light armor keeps you mobile when repositioning, and claymores protect your flanks while you're focused on distant targets. Perfect for players with steady hands who enjoy taking out enemies from afar.</li>
