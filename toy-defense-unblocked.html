                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4">üéÆ How to Play Toy Defense</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        New to tower defense games? No problem! Here's how to get started with Toy Defense:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ol class="text-white mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Place Your Units:</strong> Click on empty spots along the enemy path to place defensive units</li>
                        <li><strong>Manage Your Money:</strong> Each unit costs coins, so spend wisely and save for upgrades</li>
                        <li><strong>Upgrade Strategically:</strong> Click on existing units to upgrade them for more firepower</li>
                        <li><strong>Watch Enemy Paths:</strong> Enemies follow set routes - position your defenses to maximize attack time</li>
                        <li><strong>Complete Levels:</strong> Survive all enemy waves to complete each level and advance to harder challenges</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The controls are super intuitive - just click to place units and upgrade them. The real challenge comes from figuring out the best defensive layout and knowing when to save for powerful upgrades versus building more basic units!
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4">üèÜ Pro Defense Strategies</h2>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Master Choke Points</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The number one strategy that separates newbies from pro players is understanding choke points. These are spots where the enemy path narrows or makes tight turns, forcing enemies to bunch up. Placing your strongest units at these points gives them maximum firing time and lets their attacks hit multiple enemies. Look for corners, narrow bridges, or intersections on the map and concentrate your firepower there!
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Early Game Economy</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The first few waves are absolutely crucial for setting up your economy. Don't go crazy building tons of basic units right away! Instead, place the minimum defense needed to survive the early waves while saving up for key economic upgrades. Getting those early resource generators or high-value units will pay off massively in later waves when enemies get super tough.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Unit Type Synergy</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Different enemy types have different weaknesses, so mixing your unit types is essential. Fast-firing machine guns are perfect against hordes of weak enemies, while powerful artillery units demolish armored targets. Place complementary units near each other - like putting a unit that slows enemies next to your high-damage but slow-firing units. This combo gives your heavy hitters more time to blast away!
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Upgrade vs. New Units</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        One of the toughest decisions in Toy Defense is whether to upgrade existing units or build new ones. Generally, it's better to have a few fully upgraded units than a bunch of basic ones taking up space. Upgraded units deal WAY more damage and often gain special abilities that change the game. However, make sure you have enough coverage across the map before focusing too hard on upgrades.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Special Ability Timing</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Many advanced units have special abilities or attacks with cooldowns. Don't just activate these randomly! Save them for when big waves of powerful enemies arrive or when your defenses are about to be overwhelmed. Learning to time these special abilities perfectly can turn a sure defeat into an epic victory.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Scout Ahead</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Take advantage of the wave preview system to see what's coming next. If you notice a wave of fast enemies approaching, prioritize slowing units. If armored units are on the way, make sure your anti-armor defenses are ready. Adapting your strategy to upcoming threats is a key skill that will help you dominate the later levels.
                    </p>
