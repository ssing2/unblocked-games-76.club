                <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
                    <p class="lead">Yo, what's up gamers! Ready to dive into the awesome world of Wheely 5? This little red car is back and honestly, it's more epic than ever! If you haven't played the other Wheely games yet, don't worry - you can totally jump right into this one and still have a blast.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">üöó What's Wheely 5 All About?</h4>
                    <p>So basically, Wheely is this super cute red car who's always getting into wild adventures. In Wheely 5, our little buddy is on this crazy journey where he's gotta solve puzzles, dodge obstacles, and basically use his brain (do cars have brains? lol) to get through each level. It's like being a detective, but with wheels!</p>
                    
                    <p>The story is pretty sweet - Wheely wants to meet his car crush (aww!), but of course, nothing's ever that simple. He's gotta navigate through all these tricky situations, and that's where YOU come in! You're like his wingman, helping him figure out what to click and when to click it.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">üéÆ How to Play (It's Super Easy!)</h4>
                    <p>Okay, so here's the deal - the controls are literally just your mouse. That's it! No complicated keyboard shortcuts or anything crazy. You just click on stuff in the environment to make things happen. Maybe you'll click on a lever to move a bridge, or tap on a button to open a door. Sometimes you gotta think outside the box though!</p>
                    
                    <p>The trick is figuring out the RIGHT order to click things. Like, maybe you need to hit switch A before switch B, or wait for that moving platform to be in the perfect spot. It's all about timing and logic, which sounds boring but trust me, it's actually really satisfying when you nail it!</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">‚ú® What Makes This Game So Addictive?</h4>
                    <p>Dude, where do I even start? First off, Wheely is just adorable. Like, seriously, who doesn't love a happy little car with big googly eyes? The animations are smooth as butter, and the graphics have this cool cartoon vibe that just makes you smile.</p>
                    
                    <p>But here's what really gets you hooked - each level is like a mini brain teaser. You know that feeling when you're stuck on something for like 10 minutes, and then suddenly it clicks and you're like "OH! DUH!"? That's every single level in Wheely 5. It's that perfect sweet spot where it's challenging enough to make you think, but not so hard that you wanna throw your computer out the window.</p>
                    
                    <p>Plus, there's always something new happening. One level you might be helping Wheely get past some construction work, and the next you're dealing with crazy weather or mechanical puzzles. The developers really went all out with the variety!</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">üèÜ Pro Tips from a Wheely Veteran</h4>
                    <p>Alright, listen up - I've beaten this game like three times (yeah, I know, I have no life lol), so here are some insider tips:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li><strong>Take your time!</strong> Seriously, there's no timer, so don't rush. Look around the whole scene before you start clicking randomly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Everything has a purpose.</strong> If you see something on the screen, it's probably there for a reason. That random rock or weird machine probably does something important.</li>
                        <li><strong>Watch Wheely's face!</strong> Our little car buddy gives you hints with his expressions. If he looks worried about something, maybe don't go that way yet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Try the obvious stuff first.</strong> Sometimes the solution is simpler than you think. Don't overthink it!</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for hidden stars!</strong> Each level has hidden collectibles. They don't affect the main game, but it's fun to find them all.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">ü§î Frequently Asked Questions</h4>

                    <p><strong>Q: What if I get stuck on a level?</strong><br>
                    A: Don't stress! Take a break, grab a snack, and come back with fresh eyes. Sometimes the solution is way simpler than you think. Or you can always Google a walkthrough, no judgment here!</p>
