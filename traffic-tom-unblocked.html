                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4">🎯 Pro Traffic Control Strategies</h2>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Master the Timing Game</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Traffic Tom is all about perfect timing, and this is where most beginners totally mess up. Don't just randomly click traffic lights - you need to read the flow and anticipate what's coming next. Watch the patterns of incoming cars and learn to predict when you'll need to switch lights. The best players can see several moves ahead and set up smooth traffic flows that look almost magical.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Prioritize Emergency Vehicles</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        When you see ambulances, fire trucks, or police cars, everything else becomes secondary. These emergency vehicles need clear paths immediately, so you gotta reorganize your entire strategy on the fly. Pro tip: clear the path before they even reach the intersection - don't wait until the last second or you'll cause massive backups that'll haunt you for the rest of the level.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Understand Traffic Psychology</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Here's something most players never figure out: the cars in Traffic Tom actually behave like real drivers. Some are patient, others are aggressive, and some will try to sneak through yellow lights. Learn to identify these different "personalities" and plan accordingly. Aggressive drivers might try to run red lights, so give them extra clearance time to avoid crashes.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Manage Rush Hour Like a Boss</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Rush hour levels are where Traffic Tom separates the rookies from the legends. When traffic gets super heavy, you can't afford to make any mistakes. Focus on creating consistent flow patterns rather than trying to optimize every single car. Sometimes it's better to keep a steady rhythm going than to get fancy with your timing and mess everything up.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Use the Queue System Strategically</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Don't just focus on moving cars through - pay attention to how long the queues are getting in each direction. If one direction is backing up badly, prioritize clearing that jam even if it means making other directions wait a bit longer. A balanced approach prevents those catastrophic gridlocks that'll end your game instantly.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Learn From Your Crashes</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Every crash in Traffic Tom is a learning opportunity. Don't just restart and hope for better luck - analyze what went wrong. Was your timing off? Did you miss an emergency vehicle? Were you too focused on one direction while neglecting others? The best players treat every failure as valuable data for improving their strategy.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Stay Calm Under Pressure</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        When things get intense (and they will), the biggest mistake is panicking and clicking everything frantically. Take a deep breath, assess the situation, and make deliberate decisions. Sometimes the best move is to let a small backup happen while you focus on preventing a much bigger disaster elsewhere.
                    </p>
