                    <p>1010 Color Match is a super addictive puzzle game that will challenge your brain and keep you hooked for hours! This awesome mix of Tetris-style gameplay and color matching requires both strategy and quick thinking. Your goal is simple: place colored blocks on the grid, match colors, and clear the board to rack up points. But don't let the simplicity fool you – this game gets seriously challenging as you progress!</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes 1010 Color Match so cool is how it blends familiar puzzle mechanics with fresh twists. Unlike traditional Tetris where blocks fall automatically, here you get to decide exactly where to place each piece. The color-matching element adds another layer of strategy – matching colors clears those blocks and gives you bonus points. It's the perfect brain game for quick breaks between classes or when you're just looking to kill some time while flexing those mental muscles.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">How to Play</h4>
                    <p>Getting started with 1010 Color Match is super easy:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The Board:</strong> You'll see a square grid (usually 10×10) where you'll place blocks</li>
                        <li><strong>The Blocks:</strong> At the bottom of the screen, you'll have three different colored blocks of various shapes</li>
                        <li><strong>Placing Blocks:</strong> Click/tap on a block, then click/tap on the grid where you want to place it</li>
                        <li><strong>Matching Colors:</strong> When blocks of the same color connect, they'll be highlighted</li>
                        <li><strong>Clearing Blocks:</strong> Match enough of the same color to clear those blocks from the board</li>
                        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> You earn points for placing blocks and bonus points for clearing color matches</li>
                        <li><strong>Game Over:</strong> The game ends when you can't place any more of the available blocks on the grid</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Tips and Strategies</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Think Ahead, Like Chess</h5>
                        <p>The best players don't just focus on the current move – they think several moves ahead. Look at the three blocks you have available and plan a sequence that will set you up for success. Sometimes it's better to place a block in a less-than-ideal spot if it sets you up for a massive color clear in your next move!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Keep the Center Clear</h5>
                        <p>One of the most important strategies is to keep the center of the grid as clear as possible. Start placing blocks from the corners and edges, working your way inward. This gives you more flexibility as the game progresses and the blocks get trickier to place.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Prioritize Large Blocks</h5>
                        <p>When deciding which block to place first, usually go with the largest or most awkwardly shaped one. It's much easier to fill small gaps with single blocks later than to find space for that massive L-shaped piece when your board is nearly full!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Create Color Clusters</h5>
                        <p>Try to place blocks of the same color next to each other whenever possible. This creates clusters that you can clear all at once for major points. Sometimes it's worth sacrificing a perfect fit for the opportunity to build a large color group that you can clear later.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Balance Immediate Clears vs. Long-Term Strategy</h5>
                        <p>While clearing blocks immediately feels satisfying, sometimes it's better to hold off and build larger color groups for bigger point bonuses. The key is finding the right balance between clearing space now and setting up for bigger rewards later.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Watch for Special Patterns</h5>
                        <p>Some block arrangements create special opportunities. For example, if you can create a checkerboard pattern with alternating colors, you might be able to clear half the board with just a few strategic placements later. Look for these patterns as you play!</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Is 1010 Color Match the same as regular 1010?</h5>
                        <p>While 1010 Color Match shares some similarities with the original 1010 puzzle game, it adds the color-matching mechanic that changes the strategy completely. In regular 1010, you just need to create complete lines (like in Tetris) to clear blocks. In 1010 Color Match, you need to connect blocks of the same color to clear them, which adds a whole new layer of strategy!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I get a high score in 1010 Color Match?</h5>
                        <p>High scores come from creating large color matches and playing for as long as possible. The key is efficient board management – don't leave isolated empty spaces that can't be filled, create color clusters strategically, and always think a few moves ahead. The longer you play without running out of moves, the higher your score will climb!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Can I play 1010 Color Match on my phone?</h5>
                        <p>Absolutely! 1010 Color Match works great on mobile devices. The touch controls are super intuitive – just tap the block you want to use, then tap where you want to place it on the grid. The game is actually designed with mobile in mind, so it plays perfectly on any size screen.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Why do I keep running out of moves so quickly?</h5>
                        <p>If you're running out of moves early, you might be focusing too much on short-term gains instead of board management. Try to avoid creating small, isolated empty spaces that can't be filled with any blocks. Start from the corners and edges, and work your way inward. Also, prioritize placing larger blocks first, as they're harder to fit in later when space is limited.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Is there a way to get new blocks if I don't like the ones I have?</h5>
                        <p>Unlike some puzzle games, 1010 Color Match doesn't offer block swapping or shuffling. This is part of the challenge! You need to work with what you're given, which forces you to think creatively and develop better strategies. This limitation is actually what makes the game so addictive – you're always problem-solving with the pieces you have.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why 1010 Color Match Is So Addictive</h4>
                    <p>Ever wonder why you can't stop playing once you start? 1010 Color Match hooks you in with that perfect balance of simplicity and challenge. The rules are super easy to understand – anyone can pick it up in seconds – but mastering it takes serious skill. It's got that "just one more game" quality that keeps you coming back.</p>
                    
                    <p>The satisfaction of clearing a big chunk of blocks with a perfect color match gives you a little dopamine hit that feels amazing. And since there's no time pressure, you can think through your moves at your own pace, making it less stressful than other puzzle games where blocks are constantly falling.</p>
                    
                    <p>What's really cool is how the game evolves as you play. At first, you're just trying to place blocks anywhere they fit. But as you improve, you start developing actual strategies – planning several moves ahead, creating color clusters intentionally, and making decisions based on what blocks might come next. It's like your brain levels up while you play!</p>
                    
                    <p>Plus, the pick-up-and-play nature makes it perfect for those in-between moments during the school day. Got five minutes before class starts? That's enough time for a quick game. Need a brain break during study hall? 1010 Color Match is the perfect mental palette cleanser that actually keeps your mind sharp.</p>
