                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Game Overview</h4>
                    <p>Apple Shooter is a classic archery game that puts your precision and aim to the ultimate test! Inspired by the legendary tale of William Tell, your goal is simple but nerve-wracking: shoot apples off your friend's head without, you know, accidentally turning them into a pincushion. This game has been a staple of online gaming for years, and for good reason – it's incredibly simple to understand but surprisingly challenging to master!</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes Apple Shooter so addictive is the perfect blend of risk and reward. Each successful shot moves your character further back, making the next shot more difficult. The satisfaction of hitting that tiny apple from a ridiculous distance is what keeps players coming back for "just one more try." Plus, there's something hilariously tense about potentially shooting your virtual buddy in the face that makes this game both funny and nail-biting at the same time!</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">How to Play</h4>
                    <p>Apple Shooter has super straightforward controls:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Aim:</strong> Move your mouse to position the bow and arrow</li>
                        <li><strong>Draw:</strong> Click and hold the left mouse button to draw the bowstring</li>
                        <li><strong>Power:</strong> The longer you hold, the more power your shot will have</li>
                        <li><strong>Release:</strong> Let go of the mouse button to fire the arrow</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Consider the arrow's arc and gravity when aiming</li>
                        <li><strong>Progress:</strong> Each successful hit moves you further back for a harder shot</li>
                        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> See how far back you can get while still hitting the apple</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Remember: aim for the apple, not your friend's head! The higher you aim, the more the arrow will arc down due to gravity.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="row mt-4">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Shooting Tips and Tricks</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master the Arc</h5>
                        <p>The most important skill in Apple Shooter is understanding how your arrows arc. The further back you stand, the higher you'll need to aim to compensate for gravity. For close shots, aim almost directly at the apple. For medium-distance shots, aim slightly above it. For the extreme distances, you might need to aim significantly higher than you'd expect. Practice observing how your arrows fly and adjust accordingly!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Consistent Power</h5>
                        <p>Always draw your bow completely for maximum power. Half-drawn shots are unpredictable and will throw off your aim. Get into the habit of clicking, holding until the bow is fully drawn, then releasing. This consistency will help you focus purely on aiming rather than worrying about power levels.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Use Landmarks for Reference</h5>
                        <p>As you get pushed further back, it becomes harder to gauge where to aim. Pick visual landmarks on your screen (like clouds, trees, or edges of the game window) to help remember successful shot positions. For example, "When I'm at distance 7, I need to aim at the top-right corner of the screen." These reference points can be super helpful for consistency.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Learn from Misses</h5>
                        <p>When you miss (and you will miss... a lot), pay close attention to where your arrow lands. If you hit too low (ouch, poor friend!), aim higher next time. If your arrow flies over the apple, aim a bit lower. Each miss gives you valuable information for your next attempt. The key to mastery is adjusting based on your mistakes!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Stay Calm Under Pressure</h5>
                        <p>As you reach new distance records, it's easy to get nervous and rush your shot. Take a deep breath, focus, and shoot with the same care you did on earlier levels. Many players mess up their best runs because they get too excited or anxious. Treat every shot with the same methodical approach, regardless of how far you've progressed.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Practice the Extreme Distances</h5>
                        <p>If you're really serious about mastering Apple Shooter, focus on practicing the most difficult distances. Start a new game, quickly work your way through the easy early shots, and spend your time perfecting those seemingly impossible long-range shots. The more you practice these extreme challenges, the better your overall accuracy will become.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>What's the highest level anyone has reached in Apple Shooter?</h5>
                        <p>The game technically doesn't have a maximum level – it keeps pushing you back until the shots become practically impossible. Most casual players can reach around level 10-15 with practice. Skilled players might reach levels 20-25. Anything beyond that requires extraordinary precision and understanding of the arrow physics. There are claims online of people reaching level 30+, but those are extremely rare and would require perfect mastery of the game mechanics.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Why does my arrow sometimes go through the apple without hitting it?</h5>
                        <p>This can happen due to the game's hit detection mechanics. The apple hitbox (the area that registers as a "hit") is actually slightly smaller than the visual apple you see on screen. For a successful hit, you need to strike near the center of the apple. Grazing shots that appear to pass through the edge of the apple might not register. Always aim for the apple's center for the most reliable hits.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Is there a way to zoom in for better aiming?</h5>
                        <p>The standard version of Apple Shooter doesn't include a zoom feature – that's part of what makes the later levels so challenging! You have to make these precise shots without any aiming assists. Some modified versions of the game might include zoom features, but the classic version intentionally keeps things difficult by limiting your view to make those long-distance shots truly impressive.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Why is my friend holding so still? Wouldn't he be terrified?</h5>
                        <p>Ha! That's one brave (or foolish) friend you've got there! In the real-world William Tell legend, the person standing still was forced to do so. In the game, we just have to assume your virtual buddy either really trusts your archery skills or lost a very serious bet. His remarkable calmness while you're aiming arrows at his head is just one of those funny video game logic moments we all accept!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Is Apple Shooter appropriate for school?</h5>
                        <p>While Apple Shooter is generally considered a skill-based archery game, it does contain some cartoon violence when you miss your shots. Most schools that allow gaming during breaks probably won't have issues with it, as the graphics are simple and not realistic. However, if you're concerned, you might want to check your school's policy on games first. There are also some "kid-friendly" versions of the game with less graphic missed shots if that's a concern.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">The Legacy of Apple Shooter</h4>
                    <p>Apple Shooter isn't just any random browser game – it's a genuine internet classic that's been entertaining players for well over a decade! Back in the golden age of Flash games (RIP Flash), Apple Shooter was one of those games that everyone somehow knew about and had played at least once. Its simple premise and increasingly difficult challenge made it perfect for passing around during computer lab time or competing with friends to see who could reach the highest level.</p>
                    
                    <p>What's made this game stand the test of time is its perfect blend of accessibility and challenge. Anyone can understand "shoot the apple, not the person" within seconds, but actually pulling off those shots from ridiculous distances takes serious skill. There's no complicated storyline, no lengthy tutorials – just pure, distilled gaming challenge that hooks you instantly.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game also taps into that universal human fascination with precision challenges. It's the same appeal as carnival games where you shoot targets or throw darts – we all want to prove we have that steady hand and eagle eye. Apple Shooter just cranks up the stakes by putting a virtual human at risk (and yes, we've all intentionally missed at least once just to see what happens – admit it!).</p>
                    
                    <p>Even in today's world of high-definition graphics and complex gameplay mechanics, there's something refreshingly pure about Apple Shooter's straightforward challenge that keeps players coming back for "just one more attempt" at beating their personal best distance.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4 class="mb-3">The Physics of Archery</h4>
                    <p>Apple Shooter actually teaches you some real-world physics concepts:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Projectile Motion:</strong> The game accurately simulates how objects move through the air under gravity</li>
                        <li><strong>Parabolic Arc:</strong> Notice how arrows always follow a curved path rather than traveling in a straight line</li>
                        <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> The further your arrow travels, the more gravity pulls it downward</li>
                        <li><strong>Launch Angle:</strong> The initial angle of your shot determines both distance and height</li>
                        <li><strong>Kinetic Energy:</strong> Fully drawn bows have more power, sending arrows faster and farther</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>So next time someone says you're just playing games, tell them you're conducting physics experiments on projectile motion! Your science teacher might even be impressed (but probably don't show them what happens when you miss the apple).</p>
