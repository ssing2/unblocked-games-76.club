                <p>Hey there, puzzle lovers! If you're looking for the cutest, most fun car puzzle game to play at school, you've totally found it! Wheely 6 is this awesome point-and-click adventure where you help a super adorable red car named Wheely solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, and go on epic adventures. It's like having a pet car that needs your help to get through crazy situations!</p>

                <h2 class="text-white mt-4 mb-3">Game Overview: What Is Wheely 6?</h2>
                <p>Wheely 6 is the sixth chapter in the amazing Wheely series, and it's probably one of the most fun puzzle games you'll ever play. You control this cute little red car who always seems to get into trouble and needs your help to figure things out. Each level is like a mini puzzle where you have to click on different objects, solve problems, and help Wheely reach his goal. It's part puzzle game, part adventure, and totally addictive!</p>

                <h2 class="text-white mt-4 mb-3">How Do You Play?</h2>
                <p>Playing Wheely 6 is super easy and totally fun! All you need is your mouse (or finger if you're on a touchscreen). Just click on stuff in the game scene—buttons, levers, objects, whatever looks interesting. Sometimes you need to click things in a certain order, or figure out which button opens which door. The goal is to help Wheely get from point A to point B, but there are always obstacles, puzzles, and challenges in the way. If you mess up, no worries! You can always try again, and sometimes figuring out what went wrong is half the fun.</p>

                <h2 class="text-white mt-4 mb-3">Why Is Wheely 6 So Popular?</h2>
