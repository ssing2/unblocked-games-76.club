                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="row mt-4">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Bowling Tips and Tricks</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Aim for the Pocket</h5>
                        <p>Just like in real bowling, the highest chance of getting a strike is to hit the "pocket" - the space between the headpin (pin #1) and the pin right next to it (pin #3 for right-handed players, pin #2 for left-handed players). This creates the perfect chain reaction to knock down all pins. Position yourself slightly to the right or left of center to hit this sweet spot.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Master the Hook Shot</h5>
                        <p>Straight shots are good for picking up spares, but hook shots are the secret to consistent strikes. To throw a hook, position yourself a bit further to the side, aim straight, and as you release, move your mouse slightly in the opposite direction of where you're standing. This creates a curved trajectory that drives the ball into the pocket at the perfect angle.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Control Your Power</h5>
                        <p>More power isn't always better! A medium-power shot with the right angle often works better than a full-power shot. Pay attention to the power meter and aim for about 75-85% power for most throws. This gives you better control while still having enough momentum to clear the pins.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Pick Up Spares Like a Pro</h5>
                        <p>Picking up spares is crucial for a high score. For single pins on the sides (7 or 10 pins), position yourself on the opposite side of the lane and throw a straight ball. For splits (like the dreaded 7-10 split), aim for one pin and throw with enough power to hopefully knock it into the other pin. For clustered pins, aim for the front pin and use a slight angle.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Find Your Rhythm</h5>
                        <p>Once you find a position, angle, and power level that works for you, try to repeat it consistently. Bowling is all about consistency and muscle memory. Take mental notes of what works and stick with it. Small adjustments can make a big difference!</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>What are the rules of bowling in this game?</h5>
                        <p>3D Bowling follows standard ten-pin bowling rules. You get 10 frames, with up to two rolls per frame to knock down all 10 pins. If you knock down all pins on your first roll (a strike), you don't need a second roll and get bonus points. If you knock down all remaining pins on your second roll (a spare), you also get bonus points. Your score is calculated based on pins knocked down plus any bonus points from strikes and spares.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>What's the highest possible score in bowling?</h5>
                        <p>The perfect score in bowling is 300, which means you bowled 12 strikes in a row (one in each of the 10 frames, plus the two bonus rolls you get in the 10th frame for bowling a strike). It's super challenging to achieve, even in a video game, so if you get a 300, definitely take a screenshot and brag to your friends!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Can I play 3D Bowling on my phone or tablet?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! 3D Bowling works on most mobile devices with browsers that support HTML5. The controls are automatically adapted for touchscreens - just tap and hold to set power, then release to throw. Swipe slightly after release to add spin. It's actually pretty intuitive on touch devices!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Why is my ball going into the gutter?</h5>
                        <p>If your ball keeps ending up in the gutter, you might be adding too much spin or starting from a position that's too far to the side. Try positioning yourself more toward the center of the lane and throwing straighter shots until you get the hang of the controls. Then gradually experiment with position and spin once you're comfortable with the basics.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I get better at spares?</h5>
                        <p>Picking up spares requires precision and the right approach for different pin configurations. For single pins, aim directly at them with a straight shot. For pins on the sides, position yourself on the opposite side of the lane. Practice is key - some players even intentionally leave pins standing in practice mode to work on their spare game!</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why 3D Bowling Is Awesome</h4>
                    <p>Let's be real - bowling in real life is fun, but it can be expensive, requires special shoes, and you might not always have friends available to play with. 3D Bowling gives you all the fun without any of those downsides! You can play a quick game between classes, during lunch break, or whenever you have a few minutes to spare (pun totally intended).</p>
                    
                    <p>The 3D graphics in this game are seriously impressive for a browser game. The realistic ball physics make every throw feel satisfying, especially when you nail that perfect strike and watch all ten pins crash into each other. The sound effects add to the experience - from the roll of the ball down the lane to the crash of pins being knocked down.</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes 3D Bowling particularly cool is how it balances being easy to pick up but challenging to master. Anyone can throw the ball and hit some pins, but getting consistent strikes takes practice and skill. It's the perfect game to challenge yourself to beat your own high score or to compete with friends to see who can get the highest score in the computer lab.</p>
                    
                    <p>Plus, bowling is one of those timeless games that never goes out of style. Whether you're a serious bowler in real life or just someone looking for a fun way to pass the time, 3D Bowling delivers an authentic and enjoyable experience right in your browser. No downloads, no installations, just instant bowling action whenever and wherever you want!</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Understanding Bowling Scoring</h4>
                    <p>Bowling scoring can seem complicated at first, but once you understand it, it makes sense:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Open Frame:</strong> If you don't knock down all pins in two throws, your score is simply the number of pins you knocked down.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spare:</strong> If you knock down all pins in two throws (spare), your score for that frame is 10 plus the number of pins you knock down on your next throw.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strike:</strong> If you knock down all pins on your first throw (strike), your score for that frame is 10 plus the number of pins you knock down on your next TWO throws.</li>
                        <li><strong>10th Frame:</strong> In the final frame, you get bonus rolls if you bowl a spare or strike, allowing up to three total throws in this frame.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perfect Game:</strong> Bowling 12 strikes in a row (all frames plus bonus rolls) gives you the maximum score of 300.</li>
                    </ul>
