                    <p>Block The Pig is a super addictive strategy puzzle game that puts your planning skills to the ultimate test! The concept is deceptively simple: you need to trap a clever pig by strategically placing blocks on a grid before it reaches an exit. But don't be fooled by the cute graphics and straightforward rules – this game will seriously challenge your ability to think several steps ahead!</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes Block The Pig so engaging is how it combines the satisfaction of solving puzzles with increasingly challenging levels. The pig follows a predictable movement pattern (always trying to move toward the nearest exit), but you only get a limited number of blocks to place. As you progress, the grids become more complex with multiple exits and trickier layouts. It's like a mental chess match between you and the pig, requiring foresight, spatial awareness, and tactical thinking. Perfect for quick gaming sessions during school breaks, Block The Pig offers that "just one more level" addictiveness that keeps players coming back to outsmart that sneaky pig!</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">How to Play</h4>
                    <p>Block The Pig has simple controls but requires smart thinking:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Prevent the pig from reaching any exit by strategically placing blocks on the grid</li>
                        <li><strong>Placing Blocks:</strong> Click on an empty hexagonal space to place a block</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Resources:</strong> You only have a certain number of blocks per level (shown at the top)</li>
                        <li><strong>Pig Movement:</strong> After you place a block, the pig will move one space toward the nearest exit</li>
                        <li><strong>Pig AI:</strong> The pig always tries to take the shortest path to an exit</li>
                        <li><strong>Winning:</strong> You win by completely surrounding the pig with blocks or walls, making it impossible for it to reach any exit</li>
                        <li><strong>Losing:</strong> You lose if the pig reaches an exit or if you run out of blocks before trapping the pig</li>
                        <li><strong>Level Progression:</strong> Complete each level to unlock the next, with increasing difficulty</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Understand the Pig's Path-Finding Algorithm</h5>
                        <p>The key to mastering Block The Pig is understanding exactly how the pig thinks. The pig always moves one space toward the nearest exit, choosing the shortest available path. If two exits are equidistant, the pig will usually favor certain directions (often clockwise from top). Use this knowledge to your advantage! Before placing any blocks, mentally trace the pig's likely path to an exit. Then, strategically place blocks to force the pig to take a longer route – one that you can eventually block completely. Try to create situations where you know exactly where the pig will move next, making it easier to trap.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Create Funnels and Choke Points</h5>
                        <p>Rather than randomly placing blocks, focus on creating "funnels" that direct the pig toward a specific area where you can more easily trap it. By strategically placing blocks to close off certain paths while leaving others open, you can effectively herd the pig into a trap of your design. Look for natural choke points on the grid – areas where there are fewer possible movement options – and use these to your advantage. The ideal funnel gradually narrows the pig's options until it has only one path to follow, at which point you can close the trap.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Work Backward from Potential Traps</h5>
                        <p>One powerful strategy is to identify potential "trap zones" on the grid and work backward from there. Look for areas with natural walls or corners where you would only need a few blocks to create a complete enclosure. Then, place your blocks to guide the pig toward that trap. This approach is more efficient than reacting to the pig's movements, as it gives you a clear end goal to work toward. The best players can identify these potential traps within seconds of seeing a new level layout.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Use Walls and Edges Effectively</h5>
                        <p>The edges of the grid and existing walls are essentially free blocks – use them to your advantage! Whenever possible, try to trap the pig against the edge of the grid or existing walls, as this reduces the number of blocks you'll need to place. On levels with irregular shapes or internal walls, these features should form the foundation of your strategy. Sometimes the most efficient trap uses a corner where two walls meet, requiring as few as two or three blocks to complete the enclosure.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Force Direction Changes</h5>
                        <p>Sometimes the best strategy isn't to block the pig's path entirely, but to force it to change direction by making certain routes longer than others. By strategically placing blocks, you can manipulate which exit the pig perceives as "closest" and therefore which direction it moves. This technique is especially useful when you don't have enough blocks to create a complete enclosure immediately. By repeatedly forcing the pig to change directions, you can buy yourself time to set up a proper trap with your limited blocks.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Plan Your Block Sequence</h5>
                        <p>Since you have limited blocks, the order in which you place them matters tremendously. Before starting a level, try to plan out your entire sequence of moves. Consider how each block placement will affect the pig's path and subsequent movements. Sometimes it's better to let the pig move freely for a few turns while you set up blocks in key locations, rather than trying to block its immediate path. This "delayed gratification" approach often leads to more efficient traps that require fewer blocks overall.</p>

                        <h5>Beginner Levels (1-10)</h5>
                        <p>The early levels serve as a tutorial, introducing you to the basic mechanics of the game. These levels feature simple grid layouts with few exits and plenty of blocks to use. The pig's path is usually straightforward, and you can often trap it with minimal planning. Use these levels to understand the pig's movement patterns and practice basic trapping techniques. Don't just rush through them – take time to observe how the pig responds to different block placements, as this knowledge will be crucial in later levels. Even though these puzzles are easy, try to solve them using as few blocks as possible to develop efficient strategies.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Intermediate Levels (11-25)</h5>
                        <p>As you progress, the grids become larger with more complex layouts and multiple exits. You'll have fewer blocks relative to the grid size, requiring more careful planning. These levels introduce strategic challenges like choosing which exits to block and which to leave open temporarily. The pig's path becomes less obvious, and you'll need to think several moves ahead. Some levels may contain "red herring" paths that tempt you to waste blocks on inefficient strategies. Focus on identifying the key choke points and creating funnels to direct the pig's movement. These levels test your ability to predict the pig's behavior under various conditions.</p>

                        <p>The higher levels present serious strategic challenges that will test even experienced players. Grids become irregularly shaped with multiple paths and exits, while your block supply is severely limited. These puzzles often require counterintuitive approaches, where the optimal strategy might involve temporarily guiding the pig toward an exit before cutting off its path at the last moment. You'll need to use every trick in your arsenal – funneling, edge usage, forced direction changes, and perfect block efficiency. Some levels may seem impossible at first glance, requiring you to think outside the box and consider creative solutions that aren't immediately obvious.</p>

                        <p>If available in your version of the game, the expert levels are designed for true puzzle masters. These diabolical challenges feature complex grid layouts with minimal block allocations that leave absolutely no room for error. Success requires perfect planning from the very first move. You might need to create elaborate multi-stage traps or use advanced techniques like temporary "false exits" that manipulate the pig's pathfinding algorithm. These levels often have only one correct solution, requiring you to discover the exact sequence of block placements that will trap the pig. Completing these challenges puts you in the elite tier of Block The Pig players!</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Why does the pig sometimes move in unexpected directions?</h5>
                        <p>The pig always moves toward the nearest exit using the shortest path available. However, when two or more exits are exactly the same distance away, the pig follows a predetermined preference for certain directions. This can sometimes make its movement seem unpredictable if you haven't identified all possible exit paths. To avoid surprises, always count the exact number of steps to each exit from the pig's position before placing a block. Also, remember that the pig recalculates its path after each of your moves, so a block placement that changes the relative distances to different exits will cause the pig to change direction. Use this behavior to your advantage by strategically manipulating which exit appears "closest" to the pig.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>I've run out of blocks and the pig isn't trapped. What did I do wrong?</h5>
                        <p>This is the most common way to lose in Block The Pig, and it usually happens because of inefficient block placement. The key is planning your entire strategy before placing the first block. Ask yourself: "Am I creating the most efficient path to trap the pig?" Often, players make the mistake of simply blocking wherever the pig is about to move, which can waste blocks. Instead, try to use the grid's edges and existing walls whenever possible, as these are essentially "free blocks." Also, look for natural choke points where fewer blocks are needed to create a barrier. If you consistently run out of blocks, practice on earlier levels with a focus on using as few blocks as possible, even if the level gives you extras.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Are there any special techniques for the harder levels?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! For advanced levels, consider these specialized techniques: First, try the "false exit" strategy, where you temporarily make one exit appear closer than others to control the pig's movement, then block that path once the pig is in a position where it can be trapped more efficiently. Second, master the "dynamic rerouting" technique, where you place blocks not to trap the pig immediately, but to constantly change which exit it's heading toward, buying time until you can set up a proper enclosure. Third, learn to identify "inevitable path" scenarios, where you can predict with certainty that the pig will have to pass through a specific hexagon several moves in the future, allowing you to plan far ahead. Finally, some high-level players use "sacrifice zones" – deliberately leaving certain areas open temporarily to conserve blocks for a more efficient trap later.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Is there a way to restart a level if I make a mistake?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! Most versions of Block The Pig include a restart button, usually represented by a circular arrow icon or located in a menu. Using this will reset the current level to its starting state, allowing you to try a different approach. Don't hesitate to use this feature if you realize your current strategy isn't working – it's better to start fresh than to continue placing blocks when you know you won't be able to trap the pig. Some versions might also include an undo button that lets you take back your last move, which can be helpful for experimenting with different strategies without having to restart the entire level. Remember that puzzle games are all about learning from mistakes, so don't get discouraged if you need to restart multiple times!</p>

                        <h5>Does the game save my progress automatically?</h5>
                        <p>Most versions of Block The Pig save your progress automatically using your browser's local storage. This means you can close the game and return later to continue from the last level you unlocked. However, if you're playing on a school or public computer, be aware that your progress might be reset if the browser data is cleared between sessions. For the most reliable experience, try to complete sets of levels in one sitting when using shared computers. If you're really committed to the game, consider taking screenshots of particularly difficult levels that you've solved, so you can refer back to those solutions if your progress is ever lost. Some versions might also offer account-based saves or level codes that let you jump directly to specific challenges.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Block The Pig Is So Addictive</h4>
                    <p>Block The Pig has mastered the perfect recipe for an addictive puzzle game that keeps players coming back for "just one more level." The core appeal lies in its elegant simplicity – the rules take seconds to learn, but each level presents a unique strategic challenge. This accessibility combined with depth creates an experience that anyone can enjoy but takes real brainpower to master.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game taps into our natural problem-solving instincts. There's something deeply satisfying about outsmarting the pig's AI, predicting its movements, and setting up the perfect trap. Each level is essentially a mini chess match where you're thinking several moves ahead, and the moment when your plan comes together perfectly delivers a genuine dopamine hit. This satisfaction is amplified by the clear cause-and-effect relationship – you can immediately see how each of your decisions affects the outcome.</p>
                    
                    <p>The progression system is expertly designed to keep you engaged. Early levels build confidence and teach core mechanics, while later challenges introduce new wrinkles that force you to refine your strategies. The difficulty curve is just right – challenging enough to make success feel earned, but not so brutal that it becomes frustrating. Each level completed unlocks a slightly harder puzzle, creating a smooth progression that keeps players in that ideal "flow state" where challenge and skill are perfectly balanced.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Block The Pig respects your intelligence. Unlike many mobile or casual games that hold your hand or rely on luck, this game rewards careful thinking and planning. The pig follows consistent, predictable rules, meaning success or failure is entirely determined by your strategic choices. This sense of control and fairness is what transforms a simple puzzle game into an engaging mental workout that you'll want to return to again and again until you've outsmarted that clever pig on every single level!</p>

                        <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Each level presents a unique puzzle requiring creative solutions</li>
                        <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identifying the pig's behavior patterns improves your ability to recognize patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Prediction Skills:</strong> Anticipating the pig's movements based on the algorithm builds predictive reasoning</li>
                        <li><strong>Patience and Persistence:</strong> Challenging levels teach the value of trying different approaches</li>
                    </ul>
