                    <h4 class="mb-3">How to Play</h4>
                    <p>The rules of Ball Sort Halloween are super straightforward:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Sort all the colored balls so each tube contains only balls of a single color (or is empty)</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving Balls:</strong> Click/tap on a tube to select it, then click/tap on another tube to move the top ball</li>
                        <li><strong>Movement Rules:</strong> You can only move a ball to a tube that is either empty or has the same color ball on top</li>
                        <li><strong>Space Limits:</strong> Each tube has a fixed capacity – you can't overfill them</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Plan your moves carefully to avoid getting stuck with nowhere to move</li>
                        <li><strong>Undo:</strong> Made a mistake? Use the undo button to take back your last move</li>
                        <li><strong>Hints:</strong> If you're completely stuck, use a hint to see a suggested move (but these are limited unless you watch ads)</li>
                        <li><strong>Level Complete:</strong> Once all tubes contain balls of the same color (or are empty), you win and can move to the next level!</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Sorting Strategies and Tips</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Always Free Up a Tube First</h5>
                        <p>The #1 strategy in Ball Sort is to create at least one empty tube as quickly as possible. Having an empty tube gives you flexibility and breathing room to make more complex moves. Look for tubes that have just a few balls of the same color on top, and try to move those balls to consolidate with their matching colors in other tubes. Once you have an empty tube, you'll have much more freedom to solve the puzzle!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Think Several Moves Ahead</h5>
                        <p>Ball Sort isn't just about making the obvious immediate moves. The best players think 3-5 steps ahead, like in chess. Before moving a ball, consider: "If I move this one here, then what will my next few moves be?" Sometimes what looks like a good move now can lead to a dead end later. Develop your ability to visualize sequences of moves, and you'll solve puzzles much more efficiently.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Focus on Completing One Color at a Time</h5>
                        <p>Rather than trying to sort everything at once, focus on completely finishing one color at a time. Look for colors that are closest to being completed (like where most of the same color are already in one tube), and prioritize finishing those first. Each completed tube not only brings you closer to victory but also simplifies the puzzle by reducing the number of elements you need to keep track of.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Be Strategic About Using Temporary Storage</h5>
                        <p>Sometimes you'll need to temporarily move balls to access the ones beneath them. When doing this, try to move balls to tubes where they won't block access to other balls you'll need soon. Empty tubes are ideal for temporary storage, but if you don't have any, look for tubes that contain colors you aren't currently focusing on completing. Think of it like clearing your workspace before tackling a specific part of a project.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Don't Rush Your Moves</h5>
                        <p>Since there's no time limit, take your time to analyze the situation before making each move. A hasty move can lead to a complicated situation that's hard to fix. If you're not 100% sure about a move, mentally play through the next few steps to see if it leads where you want to go. Remember: this is a strategy game, not a speed challenge!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Use the "Same Color" Rule to Your Advantage</h5>
                        <p>Remember that you can stack balls of the same color regardless of what's beneath them. This means you can sometimes create temporary "mixed" tubes that will be easier to sort later. For example, if you have a tube with red-blue-blue-blue (from top to bottom), you might want to move that top red ball to another tube with a red on top, even if that tube has different colors below. This creates more organized "chunks" of color that are easier to move as units.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Beginner Levels (1-20)</h5>
                        <p>The early levels in Ball Sort Halloween are designed to teach you the basic mechanics. You'll typically have just 4-5 tubes with 3-4 different colors. These puzzles can usually be solved with minimal planning and are great for getting comfortable with the game's rules. Focus on understanding the basic principles of tube capacity and movement restrictions. Even if you make a few mistakes, these levels are forgiving enough that you can usually recover.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Intermediate Levels (21-50)</h5>
                        <p>As you progress, the difficulty ramps up with more tubes and colors to manage. These levels require more strategic thinking and planning several moves ahead. You'll start encountering situations where the order of your moves matters significantly, and making a wrong move early can lead to an unsolvable situation later. This is where having at least one empty tube becomes crucial for maneuverability. Pay more attention to which colors are scattered across multiple tubes versus which are mostly consolidated already.</p>

                        <h5>Advanced Levels (51-100)</h5>
                        <p>These levels will truly test your sorting skills with complex arrangements, more colors, and tricky starting positions. Some levels might seem impossible at first glance! You'll need to develop a methodical approach and sometimes make counter-intuitive moves that temporarily seem to make the situation worse but set up for better positions later. Don't get discouraged if you need to restart a level occasionally – even expert players sometimes need to try different approaches.</p>

                        <p>For the true puzzle masters, these levels require advanced techniques and sometimes seemingly impossible maneuvers. You'll need to think many steps ahead and sometimes make moves that appear to create more chaos before the solution emerges. These levels might take multiple attempts and serious concentration to solve. If you can beat these without using hints, you've truly mastered Ball Sort Halloween!</p>

                        <h5>I'm completely stuck on a level. What should I do?</h5>
                        <p>If you're truly stuck, you have a few options. First, try using the undo button to go back several moves and try a different approach. Second, sometimes starting the level over gives you a fresh perspective. Third, you can use the hint feature if available (though this might require watching an ad). Remember that every level is definitely solvable! The key insight for many difficult levels is recognizing which colors to focus on completing first and which moves create the most flexibility for later. If all else fails, take a break and come back later – sometimes your brain solves puzzles in the background!</p>

                        <h5>Does Ball Sort Halloween have a different solution strategy than regular Ball Sort?</h5>
                        <p>The core strategies are the same as regular Ball Sort games, but the Halloween edition sometimes has different level designs that may require adjusting your approach. The spooky-themed colors can also sometimes make it visually challenging to quickly identify matching balls, so you might need to pay extra attention to color matching. Otherwise, all the fundamental strategies about creating empty tubes, thinking ahead, and completing one color at a time still apply perfectly.</p>

                        <h5>Is there a limit to how many moves I can make?</h5>
                        <p>Nope! One of the best things about Ball Sort Halloween is that there's no move limit. You can take as many moves as you need to solve each puzzle. The game is about finding a solution, not doing it in the fewest moves possible. This makes it more relaxing and lets you focus on strategy rather than efficiency. Some puzzles might take 20 moves while others might take 100+ moves to solve – and that's totally fine!</p>

                        <p>Yes! Ball Sort Halloween automatically saves your progress, so you can close the browser and come back later to pick up where you left off. Just make sure you're not using incognito/private browsing mode and haven't cleared your browser cookies recently. When you return to the game, you should see a "Continue" option that will take you right back to your current level. If you're playing at school, just be aware that some school computers might clear browser data between sessions.</p>

                        <p>Yes! Compared to regular Ball Sort games, the Halloween edition features spooky-themed colors and designs like pumpkin orange, ghost white, slime green, and other Halloween-inspired elements. Some versions might include special Halloween sound effects or themed backgrounds as well. The core gameplay remains the same color-sorting challenge you love, just with a fun seasonal twist that makes it perfect for playing during the fall season!</p>

                    <p>There's something incredibly satisfying about Ball Sort Halloween that keeps players coming back for "just one more level." Part of the appeal is the clear visual progress – seeing those mixed-up tubes slowly transform into neatly organized columns of matching colors hits the same part of your brain that enjoys organizing a messy room or lining things up perfectly. It's like digital tidying that gives you that "ahh, everything's in order" feeling.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game also strikes that perfect balance between being challenging enough to engage your brain but not so difficult that it becomes frustrating. You always feel like the solution is just within reach, even when you're stuck. And when you do solve a particularly tricky level, that little dopamine hit of accomplishment feels genuinely rewarding. It's challenging your brain in a way that feels productive rather than stressful.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Halloween theme adds another layer of enjoyment, especially for players who love the spooky season. The themed colors and designs bring a fun seasonal twist to the classic formula, making each completed level feel like a mini Halloween celebration. It's like getting to enjoy a bit of Halloween spirit any time of year!</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Ball Sort Halloween is the perfect "pick up and play" game. You can enjoy it for just a few minutes during a break, or spend hours gradually working through the more challenging levels. There's no pressure, no time limits, and no penalties for taking your time – just pure puzzle-solving satisfaction at your own pace.</p>
