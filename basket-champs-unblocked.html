                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Basketball Strategies</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master the Shot Timing</h5>
                        <p>The key to scoring consistently in Basket Champs is perfecting your shot timing. Unlike real basketball where distance matters most, in this game it's all about releasing the ball at the peak of your jump. Watch your player's animation carefully and release the shoot button when they reach the highest point of their jump. You'll know you've got perfect timing when you see a small visual effect around the ball. Practice this timing in single-player mode before challenging your friends, and you'll be draining shots like a pro!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Use the Crossover to Break Ankles</h5>
                        <p>When you're facing tough defense, rapid direction changes are your best friend. By quickly alternating between opposite movement keys (like A and D or left and right arrows), you can perform a crossover dribble that often leaves defenders in the dust. This move is especially effective when you're close to the basket and need to create space for a shot. Time your crossover right before your opponent lunges for a steal, then quickly drive to the basket for an easy layup or dunk!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Don't Spam the Steal Button</h5>
                        <p>One of the biggest mistakes new players make is constantly mashing the steal button on defense. This actually leaves you vulnerable because there's a brief recovery period after each failed steal attempt. Instead, play patient defense by staying in front of your opponent and only attempt steals when they're exposing the ball (like during a dribble move or when they're beginning their shooting motion). Well-timed steals lead to easy fast break points, while spam-stealing leads to your opponent blowing past you for an open shot.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Save Your Special Move for Clutch Moments</h5>
                        <p>Your special move meter fills up gradually as you perform successful actions like scoring, stealing, or blocking shots. When it's full, you might be tempted to use it right away, but strategic players save their specials for game-changing moments. The best times to unleash your special are when you're down by a few points and need a guaranteed basket, when the shot clock is winding down, or when you need to make a crucial defensive stop. Some characters have offensive specials (like guaranteed shots), while others have defensive specials (like super blocks) â€“ know your character's strengths!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Master the Pump Fake</h5>
                        <p>To perform a pump fake, quickly press and release the shoot button without actually taking a shot. This will make your player go through the beginning of their shooting motion, often tricking defenders into jumping for a block. Once they're in the air, they can't jump again for a brief moment â€“ giving you the perfect opportunity to step around them for an open shot or drive to the basket. This technique is absolutely deadly in close games against human opponents who tend to be block-happy!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Use the Backboard for Tough Angles</h5>
                        <p>Just like in real basketball, using the backboard can make certain shots easier, especially when you're approaching the basket from the sides. Instead of trying to swish every shot, aim slightly above the rim when you're at an angle to use the backboard to your advantage. This technique is particularly effective for layups and close-range shots when defenders are in your face. Some characters even have special animations for bank shots that have a higher success rate than regular jump shots from the same position!</p>

                        <h5>Speed Demons</h5>
                        <p>Characters like Flash and Bolt prioritize quickness over power. They excel at driving to the basket, stealing the ball, and fast break opportunities. When playing as these characters, focus on quick cuts to the basket rather than jump shots. Their special moves typically involve super-speed bursts that let them blow past defenders. On defense, use their quickness to apply pressure and force turnovers rather than going for blocks. These characters are perfect for players who prefer a run-and-gun style with lots of layups and dunks.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Sharpshooters</h5>
                        <p>Characters like Sniper and Deadeye have exceptional shooting accuracy, especially from distance. They're not as quick as other characters, but they can score consistently from anywhere on the court. When using these characters, create space for jump shots rather than forcing drives to the basket. Their special moves often guarantee a perfect shot even when heavily defended. On defense, they might lack lateral quickness, so focus on positioning rather than pressuring the ball handler. These characters are ideal for players who enjoy scoring through well-timed shots rather than aggressive drives.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Power Players</h5>
                        <p>Characters like Crusher and Titan emphasize strength over finesse. They excel at dunking, rebounding, and blocking shots. When playing as these characters, use their size advantage to bully smaller defenders and grab offensive rebounds for second-chance points. Their special moves typically involve powerful dunks that can't be blocked or dominant defensive plays. On defense, position yourself near the basket to block shots and control the boards. These characters are perfect for players who enjoy a physical play style focused on inside scoring and defensive intimidation.</p>

                        <h5>All-Rounders</h5>
                        <p>Characters like Captain and Star offer balanced attributes without significant weaknesses. They can shoot reasonably well, drive effectively, and play solid defense. When using these characters, adapt your strategy based on what the defense gives you rather than forcing a particular play style. Their special moves are often versatile, providing advantages in various situations. These characters are great for beginners or players who want flexibility in their approach to the game.</p>

                        <h5>Can I play Basket Champs with my friend on the same computer?</h5>
                        <p>Absolutely! One of the best features of Basket Champs is its local multiplayer mode. Two players can compete on the same keyboard using the controls listed above. Player 1 uses WASD for movement and J, K, L for actions, while Player 2 uses arrow keys and numpad buttons. Just select the "2 Players" option from the main menu to start a head-to-head match. This makes it perfect for playing with friends during lunch breaks or after school when you're sharing a computer. Just make sure you have enough space for both players to access their keys comfortably!</p>

                        <h5>How do I unlock new characters and courts?</h5>
                        <p>New characters and courts are typically unlocked by progressing through the tournament mode or achieving specific milestones. To unlock content faster, focus on completing the single-player tournament with different characters, achieving high scores, and winning by significant margins. Some versions of the game might also unlock content based on the total number of games you've played or points you've scored. The exact requirements vary between versions, but consistently playing and improving will eventually unlock everything. Some special characters might require completing specific challenges like winning without missing a shot or scoring a certain number of points with a specific character.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Why is my shooting percentage so low?</h5>
                        <p>If you're struggling with shooting accuracy, you're probably not timing your shots correctly. Remember that in Basket Champs, the key to successful shooting is releasing the ball at the peak of your jump â€“ not too early, not too late. Each character also has slightly different shooting animations and timing, so practice with your favorite character to get a feel for their unique rhythm. Additionally, shot difficulty increases when defenders are close or when you're off-balance. Try creating more space before shooting, and avoid shooting while moving laterally. If you're still having trouble, try playing the practice mode where you can work on your timing without pressure from defenders or the game clock.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I perform dunks and special moves?</h5>
                        <p>Dunks happen automatically when you're close enough to the basket with enough momentum and press the shoot button. To increase your chances of dunking, sprint toward the basket (by holding the movement key in one direction) and press shoot when you're just a step or two away from the hoop. As for special moves, each character builds up a special meter by performing successful actions like scoring, stealing, or blocking. When the meter is full (usually indicated by a glowing icon or full bar somewhere on the screen), press the special move button (U for Player 1, Numpad 0 for Player 2) to activate it. Each character has unique special moves ranging from guaranteed shots to defensive boosts or speed bursts.</p>

                        <h5>Does the game save my progress automatically?</h5>
                        <p>Yes, Basket Champs typically saves your progress automatically using your browser's local storage. This includes unlocked characters, courts, your win-loss record, and tournament progress. Just make sure you're not playing in incognito/private browsing mode and that you haven't cleared your browser cookies recently. If you're playing at school, be aware that some school computers might clear browser data between sessions, which could reset your progress. For the most reliable experience, try to unlock content and make progress when you're using a personal device where data won't be cleared.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Basket Champs Is So Addictive</h4>
                    <p>Basket Champs has mastered the formula for an addictive gaming experience that keeps players coming back for "just one more game." The matches are short enough (usually 2-3 minutes) to fit perfectly into quick breaks between classes, but they're packed with enough action and excitement to deliver a satisfying experience every time. This bite-sized gameplay is ideal for the school environment where you might only have a few minutes to play.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game strikes that perfect balance between accessibility and depth that hooks players of all skill levels. Beginners can jump in and start having fun immediately thanks to the simple controls and intuitive gameplay. But underneath this simplicity lies a surprising amount of strategy and skill expression through shot timing, special moves, and defensive positioning. This creates a rewarding learning curve where you can see yourself improving with each game you play.</p>
                    
                    <p>The competitive aspect of Basket Champs is another huge part of its appeal, especially the local multiplayer mode. There's nothing quite like the thrill of going head-to-head with a friend sitting right next to you, talking trash as you drain a three-pointer in their face or make a clutch steal in the final seconds. These shared gaming moments create memories and friendly rivalries that extend beyond the screen.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Basket Champs taps into the universal appeal of basketball â€“ a sport that's already popular among students â€“ but presents it in a more accessible, exaggerated form where everyone can feel like a star player. The satisfaction of perfectly timing a shot, executing a slick crossover, or pulling off a game-winning dunk delivers that dopamine hit that keeps you engaged match after match. It's like having all the excitement of basketball without needing actual athletic skills or a real court!</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Tips for Winning Tournaments</h4>
                    <p>Want to dominate the tournament mode? Here's how:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Choose the Right Character:</strong> Different tournaments have different challenges. Speed characters excel in tournaments with lots of fast breaks, while power characters dominate in physical matchups. Pick a character that suits the tournament style.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manage Your Energy:</strong> Tournament play requires stamina. Don't exhaust your special moves in early rounds if you can win without them. Save your best tricks for the tougher opponents in later brackets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Learn AI Patterns:</strong> Computer opponents have predictable behaviors. Some AI players always go for three-pointers, while others drive to the basket consistently. Recognize these patterns and adjust your defense accordingly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus on Defense:</strong> While scoring is flashy, strong defense wins tournaments. A well-timed block or steal can completely change the momentum of a close game.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice Clutch Shooting:</strong> Tournament finals often come down to the final seconds. Practice shooting under pressure by creating your own scenarios where you need to make the last shot.</li>
