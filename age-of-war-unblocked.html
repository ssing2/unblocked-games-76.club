                    <p>Getting started with Age of War is super easy:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Creating Units:</strong> Click on unit buttons at the bottom of the screen to create soldiers that automatically march toward the enemy base</li>
                        <li><strong>Managing Gold:</strong> Each unit costs gold, which generates automatically over time. Killing enemy units also earns you gold</li>
                        <li><strong>Experience Points:</strong> Defeated enemies give you XP, which fills your special attack meter</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Attacks:</strong> Once the meter is full, click the special attack button to unleash a powerful ability that damages multiple enemies</li>
                        <li><strong>Turret Defense:</strong> Place defensive turrets on your base to automatically attack incoming enemy units</li>
                        <li><strong>Evolution:</strong> When you've gathered enough gold, click the evolution button to advance to the next age, unlocking stronger units and defenses</li>
                        <li><strong>Victory:</strong> Destroy the enemy base completely to win the game</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Winning Strategies and Tips</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master the Art of Unit Countering</h5>
                        <p>Each unit type has strengths and weaknesses against other units. Learning these matchups is crucial for victory! For example, ranged units are great against flying units but vulnerable to fast melee attackers. When you see your opponent deploying a specific unit type, counter it with the appropriate unit. This strategy is way more effective than just spamming the most expensive unit you can afford.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Time Your Evolutions Strategically</h5>
                        <p>Evolving to the next age is awesome, but the timing is super important. Don't evolve when you're being overwhelmed by enemy forces – you'll be vulnerable during the transition. Instead, evolve right after you've pushed back the enemy or when there's a lull in the battle. Also, make sure you have enough gold left over after evolving to immediately create some new units for defense!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Use Special Attacks at the Perfect Moment</h5>
                        <p>Your special attack can totally change the course of a battle, but don't waste it! Save it for when the enemy has grouped several units together for maximum damage. Special attacks are also perfect for stopping a major enemy push that's threatening your base. Each age has a different special attack, so learn their effects and master their timing.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Balance Your Economy</h5>
                        <p>A common mistake is spending all your gold as soon as you get it. Sometimes it's better to save up for stronger units or evolution rather than constantly deploying weaker units. However, don't be too greedy – if you save too much while your opponent is building an army, you'll get overwhelmed. Finding that perfect balance between spending and saving is key to dominating in Age of War.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Don't Neglect Your Turrets</h5>
                        <p>Defensive turrets are absolutely clutch in Age of War! They provide consistent damage without requiring constant attention. Upgrade your turrets whenever possible, especially in later ages where they become seriously powerful. A fully upgraded turret in the final age can shred incoming enemies and buy you valuable time to build up your forces.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Scout Your Enemy</h5>
                        <p>Pay attention to what units your opponent is creating and what age they're in. If you notice them saving up (not deploying units for a while), they might be preparing to evolve. This is the perfect time to launch an aggressive attack to disrupt their plans! Observing your enemy's patterns and adapting your strategy accordingly is what separates the good players from the great ones.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Prehistoric Age</h5>
                        <p>The first age features cavemen with clubs, ranged attackers with slingshots, and the pterodactyl as a flying unit. Your special attack is a dinosaur that tramples enemy units. While units in this age are weak, they're cheap to produce, allowing you to quickly build a numbers advantage. Don't rush to evolve unless you're comfortable handling the increased unit costs in the next age.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Ancient Age</h5>
                        <p>The second age introduces soldiers with swords and shields, archers, and hot air balloons. Your special attack summons a chariot that charges through enemy lines. Units cost more but are significantly stronger. The defensive turret upgrade becomes more important here. This is a good age to establish control before moving to the next evolution.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Medieval Age</h5>
                        <p>The third age features knights, catapults, and dragons. Your special attack calls down a storm of arrows on the battlefield. This age has excellent balance between unit cost and power. The dragon unit is particularly strong and can change the course of battle if used correctly. Many players find the Medieval Age to be the sweet spot for pushing an advantage.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Modern Age</h5>
                        <p>The fourth age introduces soldiers with guns, tanks, and helicopters. Your special attack is an airstrike that bombs a large area. Units in this age deal massive damage but are expensive. The defensive turret becomes a machine gun nest that can mow down multiple enemies. If you can afford to maintain unit production, this age can quickly overwhelm opponents in earlier ages.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Future Age</h5>
                        <p>The final age features laser soldiers, mech walkers, and UFOs. Your special attack is a devastating laser beam that cuts through everything in its path. Units and the defensive laser turret in this age are extremely powerful but come with the highest gold cost. If you reach this age while your opponent is still in an earlier era, you'll have a massive advantage – but beware of leaving yourself broke after evolving!</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>What's the best age to stay in?</h5>
                        <p>There's no single "best" age – it depends on your situation and playstyle. The Medieval Age offers great balance between unit cost and power, making it popular for many players. However, if you can maintain unit production in the Modern or Future Age, their superior firepower can quickly overwhelm opponents. Sometimes, staying in a lower age to spam cheaper units can be more effective than evolving if your economy isn't strong enough yet.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I deal with flying units?</h5>
                        <p>Flying units can be tricky to handle! The most effective counters are ranged units (like archers, gunners, or laser troops) and your own flying units. In a pinch, special attacks can also clear out groups of flying enemies. Don't waste your melee units on flying enemies – they won't be able to attack them! If you're constantly getting overwhelmed by flying units, invest in more ranged defenders and upgrade your defensive turret.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>What should I prioritize: units or turret upgrades?</h5>
                        <p>It's all about balance! Early in the game, focus on creating units to establish battlefield control. As you advance to later ages, turret upgrades become increasingly valuable – a fully upgraded Future Age turret is an absolute beast! A good rule of thumb: if you're playing aggressively and pushing toward the enemy base, prioritize units. If you're playing defensively or need to rebuild after an enemy push, upgrade your turret to help hold the line.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Is it better to save for evolution or create more units?</h5>
                        <p>This is the eternal Age of War dilemma! If you're dominating with your current units and have the enemy on the back foot, it might be better to keep the pressure on rather than saving for evolution. However, if the battle is at a stalemate or you're struggling against enemy units, evolving to access stronger troops might be the play. Just remember: don't leave yourself completely defenseless while saving up!</p>

                        <h5>Are there different game modes in Age of War?</h5>
                        <p>The original Age of War focuses on the classic one-on-one battle mode. However, some versions and sequels of the game include additional modes like survival mode (where you face increasingly difficult waves of enemies) or challenge modes with specific objectives. The unblocked browser version typically includes the classic battle mode that made the game famous.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Age of War Is a Classic</h4>
                    <p>Age of War has earned its place as one of the most beloved strategy games of the Flash game era, and it's not hard to see why. There's something incredibly satisfying about watching your base evolve from a primitive cave to a futuristic fortress, with your units transforming alongside it. The game perfectly captures the feeling of technological progress throughout human history in a way that's both educational and just plain cool.</p>
                    
                    <p>The simplicity of the controls masks the surprising depth of strategy involved. New players can jump in and start creating units immediately, but mastering the timing of evolutions, the perfect unit counters, and the ideal moments for special attacks takes practice and skill. It's that perfect balance of accessibility and depth that keeps players coming back for "just one more game" again and again.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game also hits that sweet spot of session length – a typical match lasts around 5-10 minutes, making it perfect for a quick gaming break between classes or during lunch. You can get a complete, satisfying gaming experience without needing to commit hours of your time.</p>
                    
                    <p>And let's not forget that iconic soundtrack! The Age of War theme has become legendary among gamers, with its catchy beat that somehow perfectly captures the epic struggle of civilizations clashing across time. Many players find themselves humming the tune long after they've stopped playing.</p>

                    <p>Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each unit type is crucial:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Melee Units:</strong> Your frontline fighters. Cheap and effective against ground units but vulnerable to ranged attacks and useless against flying units.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ranged Units:</strong> Can attack from a distance and hit flying units. More expensive than melee units but safer since they attack from behind your frontline.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flying Units:</strong> Can bypass enemy ground units to attack their ranged troops directly. Expensive but great for disrupting enemy formations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heavy Units:</strong> (Like tanks and mech walkers in later ages) Deal massive damage and have high health. Very expensive but can break through tough defenses.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The key to victory is creating a balanced army that can handle whatever your opponent throws at you. Don't put all your gold into one unit type!</p>
