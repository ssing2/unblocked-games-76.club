                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master the Art of Strafing</h5>
                        <p>The best tank commanders never stop moving! Standing still makes you an easy target, so get into the habit of "strafing" â€“ moving side to side while shooting. This makes you much harder to hit while still allowing you to maintain your aim on enemies. Circle around slower enemies and back away from charging ones. Remember: a moving tank is a surviving tank!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Prioritize Your Upgrades Strategically</h5>
                        <p>How you spend your hard-earned cash can make or break your game. While it's tempting to max out your firepower first, a balanced approach is usually better. Start by upgrading your health and speed to decent levels for survivability, then focus on your main cannon's damage and fire rate. Special weapons are awesome but expensive â€“ save them for when you're struggling with particular levels. For beginners, prioritize health > speed > damage > fire rate > special weapons.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Use the Environment to Your Advantage</h5>
                        <p>The levels in Awesome Tanks 2 are full of walls, crates, and barriers â€“ use them! Position yourself so that obstacles block enemy fire while you can still shoot around corners. Some walls can be destroyed, while others are permanent â€“ learning which is which is crucial for developing effective strategies. When surrounded, retreat to a narrow passage where enemies can only approach you one at a time instead of getting caught in the open.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Know Your Enemy Types</h5>
                        <p>Different enemies require different tactics. Fast-moving light tanks should be taken out quickly before they can flank you. Heavy tanks have lots of health but move slowly â€“ keep your distance and chip away at them. Turrets can't move but have long range â€“ take them out from angles where other enemies can't hit you. For boss tanks, focus on staying alive first, dealing damage second. Study how each enemy behaves and prioritize the most dangerous ones first!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Conserve Your Special Weapons</h5>
                        <p>Special weapons like missiles and mines are super powerful but have limited ammo. Save them for tough situations like being surrounded or for taking down boss tanks. Don't waste them on basic enemies you can handle with your main cannon! A smart commander keeps their special weapons in reserve for when things get really intense. Think of them as your "get out of trouble" card rather than your go-to attack.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Master the Mini-map</h5>
                        <p>The mini-map in the corner of your screen isn't just decoration â€“ it's a crucial tactical tool! Use it to spot enemies before they appear on screen, plan your route through the level, and avoid getting surrounded. A quick glance at the mini-map can save your tank from an ambush. Some levels have hidden areas or shortcuts that are easier to spot on the mini-map than during the heat of battle.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Health & Armor</h5>
                        <p>Your tank's health determines how much damage you can take before exploding. Early upgrades here give you more room for error and are especially valuable for beginners. By mid-game, aim to have at least level 3-4 health to survive the increasingly tough enemies. Maximum health becomes essential for the brutal final levels and boss fights.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Speed & Handling</h5>
                        <p>Speed affects how quickly your tank moves around the battlefield. Better speed means you can dodge enemy fire more effectively, retreat when necessary, and position yourself more quickly. While it might not seem as exciting as weapon upgrades, good mobility is often the difference between victory and defeat. Aim for at least level 3 speed by mid-game.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Main Cannon</h5>
                        <p>Your primary weapon has two upgrade paths: damage and fire rate. Damage increases how much hurt each shot puts on enemies, while fire rate determines how quickly you can shoot. A balanced approach works well, though slight emphasis on damage can be more efficient. By late-game, you'll want both maxed out to deal with the toughest enemies.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Special Weapons</h5>
                        <p>These are your heavy hitters for tough situations. The missile launcher fires powerful rockets that deal massive damage in a small area. The mine dropper lets you place explosives that detonate when enemies roll over them â€“ perfect for defensive play. The airstrike calls in a bombing run that damages everything in a large area â€“ ideal for clearing crowded rooms. Choose based on your playstyle, but the missile launcher offers the best balance of power and precision for most situations.</p>

                        <p>For new players, here's a suggested upgrade order: Get Health to level 2 â†’ Speed to level 2 â†’ Main Cannon Damage to level 3 â†’ Fire Rate to level 2 â†’ Health to level 4 â†’ Speed to level 3 â†’ Unlock Missile Launcher â†’ Continue balancing upgrades based on what challenges you're facing. This path gives you enough survivability early while building up your offensive capabilities for the mid-game.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I beat the Level 10 Boss?</h5>
                        <p>The Level 10 Boss (the Big Bertha tank) is one of the first major challenges in the game. This massive tank has heavy armor and a rotating triple cannon. The key to defeating it is patience and movement. Keep circling the boss while maintaining your distance, and only stop briefly to fire. Focus on dodging its projectiles first, attacking second. Its attack pattern is predictable â€“ it fires three shots in succession, then pauses before rotating its turret. Attack during these pauses! If you have missiles, save them for when you have a clear shot. This fight is much easier if you've upgraded your speed to at least level 3.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>What's the best special weapon to use?</h5>
                        <p>Each special weapon has its strengths, but the Missile Launcher is generally considered the most versatile. It deals high damage to single targets and has a small splash damage area, making it effective against both bosses and groups of smaller enemies. The Mine Dropper is great for defensive play and creating safe zones, while the Airstrike is best for clearing rooms full of enemies. If you're new to the game, start with the Missile Launcher until you develop your own playstyle and preferences.</p>

                        <h5>I keep dying on later levels. What am I doing wrong?</h5>
                        <p>If you're struggling with the later levels (15+), there are a few common issues to check: 1) Are your upgrades balanced? Having powerful weapons won't help if your tank is too slow or fragile. 2) Are you staying mobile? Standing still is a death sentence in later levels. 3) Are you using the mini-map to avoid getting surrounded? 4) Are you conserving your special weapon ammo for tough situations? Sometimes it's also worth replaying earlier levels to farm more cash for upgrades before tackling the harder content.</p>

                    <p>Awesome Tanks 2 has earned its place as one of the most popular tank games online for good reason. It strikes that perfect balance between being easy to pick up but hard to master. The controls are intuitive enough that anyone can jump in and start blasting away, but the progressively challenging levels ensure that even veteran gamers will find plenty to test their skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>What really sets this game apart from other tank games is its upgrade system. There's something incredibly satisfying about starting with a basic tank and transforming it into a customized war machine. Each upgrade feels meaningful and noticeable, giving you a real sense of progression as you advance. The strategic choices you make in how to upgrade your tank add a layer of depth that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging.</p>
                    
                    <p>The level design deserves special mention too. Each new stage introduces new challenges, enemy types, or environmental obstacles that force you to adapt your tactics. Just when you think you've mastered the game, it throws something new at you to keep you on your toes. The boss battles serve as perfect capstones to test everything you've learned and upgraded.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Awesome Tanks 2 just feels good to play. The satisfying explosions, the crisp movement, the powerful sound effects when you fire your weapons â€“ it all comes together to create an experience that's just plain fun. Whether you're looking for a quick gaming session during lunch break or a longer campaign to conquer, this tank battler delivers the goods!</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Level Strategies</h4>
                    <p>Different level types require different approaches:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Open Arena Levels:</strong> Stay mobile, use strafing tactics, and utilize the full space to avoid getting cornered. Keep an eye on the mini-map to avoid surprise attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maze Levels:</strong> Move carefully and use corners for cover. Clear sections methodically rather than rushing forward. Place mines at intersections to protect your flanks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Turret-Heavy Levels:</strong> Focus on taking out turrets first from maximum range, then deal with mobile enemies. Use obstacles to block lines of fire while you pick off enemies one by one.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boss Levels:</strong> Study the boss's attack pattern before committing to an aggressive approach. Most bosses have predictable patterns that can be exploited. Save your special weapons for these encounters!</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Remember that sometimes retreating to a better position is smarter than pressing forward. There's no time limit on most levels, so patience and positioning often win the day!</p>
