                    <h4 class="mb-3">How to Play</h4>
                    <p>Ball Sort Soccer has simple rules that anyone can learn:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Sort all the soccer balls so each tube contains only balls of the same color (or is empty)</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving Balls:</strong> Click/tap on a tube to select it, then click/tap on another tube to move the top ball</li>
                        <li><strong>Movement Rules:</strong> You can only move a ball to a tube that is either empty or has the same color ball on top</li>
                        <li><strong>Tube Capacity:</strong> Each tube can only hold a limited number of balls (usually 4)</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Plan your moves carefully to avoid getting stuck with nowhere to move</li>
                        <li><strong>Undo:</strong> Made a mistake? Use the undo button to take back your last move</li>
                        <li><strong>Hints:</strong> If you're completely stuck, use a hint to see a suggested move</li>
                        <li><strong>Level Complete:</strong> When all tubes contain balls of a single color or are empty, you advance to the next level</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Soccer Sorting Strategies</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Create an Empty "Midfielder" Tube</h5>
                        <p>In soccer, midfielders control the game by creating space and options – and that's exactly what an empty tube does in Ball Sort Soccer! Your first priority should be creating at least one empty tube as quickly as possible. Look for tubes that have just a few balls of the same color on top that you can move to consolidate with matching colors. Having an empty tube gives you crucial flexibility for more complex moves. Think of it as your playmaker that opens up passing lanes for the rest of your moves!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Build from the "Defense" Up</h5>
                        <p>Just like a soccer team builds attacks from solid defense, focus on the bottom balls in each tube first. Try to create solid foundations of the same color in each tube, then build upward. If you have a tube with three red balls at the bottom and a blue on top, prioritize moving that blue ball elsewhere so you can complete the red tube. Having several tubes with solid color foundations makes the endgame much easier to manage. This is your defensive strategy that sets up your winning attack!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Scout the Field Before Making Moves</h5>
                        <p>Great soccer players scan the field before receiving the ball – apply the same principle here! Before making any move, take time to study the entire layout. Look at all tubes to understand where each color is distributed and which moves might create better opportunities later. Sometimes the best immediate move isn't obvious until you've analyzed the whole field. This careful observation prevents you from making moves that seem good now but lead to dead ends later.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Use the "Possession" Strategy</h5>
                        <p>In modern soccer, maintaining possession is key – in Ball Sort Soccer, controlling your empty tubes is just as important! Don't waste your empty tube space on just any move. Use it strategically to temporarily hold balls that are blocking access to important color groups. Once you've moved the blocking ball and accessed the colors you need, you can move the temporary ball to its final destination. This keeps you in control of the puzzle's "possession" rather than making desperate moves.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Complete One "Team" Color at a Time</h5>
                        <p>Instead of trying to work on all colors simultaneously, focus on completing one color at a time – like a coach focusing on getting one player into scoring position. Look for colors that are closest to being fully sorted and prioritize those. Each completed tube not only brings you closer to victory but also simplifies the puzzle by reducing the variables you need to manage. This focused approach prevents you from spreading your attention too thin across too many incomplete tasks.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Master the Art of the "Substitution"</h5>
                        <p>Soccer coaches make tactical substitutions to change the game – in Ball Sort Soccer, strategic temporary moves serve the same purpose! Sometimes you need to move balls in a sequence that isn't immediately obvious. For example, you might need to temporarily move a ball to an empty tube, then move another ball to its proper destination, then return the first ball to where it belongs. These multi-step "substitutions" are often the key to solving the most challenging levels. Think several moves ahead, like a chess player or a soccer strategist planning a complex attack!</p>

                        <h5>Beginner "Training Ground" Levels</h5>
                        <p>The early levels in Ball Sort Soccer introduce you to the basic mechanics with simpler arrangements. These typically feature 4-5 tubes with 3-4 different colored balls. While these levels can often be solved through trial and error, use them to practice good habits like creating empty tubes and thinking ahead. These are like your training sessions before the big matches – perfect for mastering the fundamentals without too much pressure.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h5>Intermediate "League Match" Levels</h5>
                        <p>As you progress, you'll face more complex arrangements with more colors and tubes. These levels require more strategic thinking and planning several moves ahead. You'll start encountering situations where the order of your moves significantly impacts your ability to solve the puzzle. This is where having at least one empty tube becomes crucial. These levels are like regular season matches – challenging but manageable with solid strategy and focus.</p>

                        <p>The higher levels feature complex arrangements with 7+ colors and strategic starting positions designed to challenge your puzzle-solving skills. Some of these might seem impossible at first glance! You'll need to develop advanced techniques like temporary holding patterns and multi-step moves. These levels are the championships of Ball Sort Soccer – they'll test everything you've learned and push your strategic thinking to new levels.</p>

These are like the special cup tournaments in soccer – they break from the usual format and require adaptability and creative thinking!</p>

                        <h5>How does Ball Sort Soccer differ from regular Ball Sort games?</h5>
                        <p>The core mechanics are similar to classic Ball Sort puzzles, but Ball Sort Soccer adds soccer-themed visuals and design elements that make it more engaging for sports fans. The balls feature soccer patterns and team colors, and the backgrounds often resemble stadiums or soccer fields. Some versions also include soccer-themed sound effects and special level designs inspired by famous tournaments or soccer concepts. The strategic thinking required is similar, but the sports theme adds a fresh and fun dimension to the classic puzzle format!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>I'm stuck on a level. What should I do?</h5>
                        <p>First, try using the undo button to backtrack and try a different approach. Sometimes starting over with a fresh perspective can help you see solutions you missed before. Look for tubes that are closest to being completed and focus on those first. If you're truly stuck, most versions of the game offer a hint feature that will show you a suggested move, though this might require watching an ad or using in-game currency. Remember that every level is definitely solvable – sometimes the solution requires thinking several moves ahead in a sequence that might not be immediately obvious.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Can I play Ball Sort Soccer offline?</h5>
                        <p>The browser version requires an internet connection to load initially. However, once the game is loaded, many versions will continue to function even if your connection drops temporarily. For truly offline play, you might want to check if there's a mobile app version available for download from app stores. These mobile versions typically allow for complete offline play after installation. The unblocked browser version is designed primarily for online play at places like schools where other games might be restricted.</p>

                        <h5>Does my progress save automatically?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! Ball Sort Soccer typically saves your progress automatically using browser storage, so you can close the game and return later to continue from where you left off. Just make sure you're not playing in incognito/private browsing mode and haven't cleared your browser cookies recently. If you're playing at school, be aware that some school computers might clear browser data between sessions, which could reset your progress. For the most reliable experience, try to complete levels in one session when possible.</p>

                        <p>Depending on the specific version, Ball Sort Soccer might include special features like extra hints, auto-solve for particularly difficult levels, or the ability to add extra tubes for more flexibility. Some versions might offer these as rewards for watching ads or as part of daily login bonuses. These power-ups can be super helpful when you're stuck on a challenging level, but try not to rely on them too much – part of the fun is developing your own strategic thinking skills to solve the puzzles!</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Ball Sort Soccer Scores Big</h4>
                    <p>Ball Sort Soccer has become a fan favorite by perfectly blending two popular interests: puzzle-solving and soccer. For soccer fans, the themed graphics and sports elements add a familiar and fun context to the puzzle mechanics. For puzzle enthusiasts, the core color-sorting challenge remains satisfyingly intact while gaining a fresh visual style. It's like getting the best of both worlds – brain exercise with a sporty twist!</p>
                    
                    <p>The game hits that sweet spot of being easy to understand but challenging to master. Anyone can grasp the basic concept in seconds, but solving the increasingly complex levels requires genuine strategic thinking and planning. This accessibility combined with depth is what keeps players coming back for "just one more level" – before you know it, you've spent an hour sorting colorful soccer balls!</p>
                    
                    <p>One of the biggest appeals of Ball Sort Soccer is its pick-up-and-play nature. With no time limits and simple controls, it's perfect for those in-between moments during the school day. Got five minutes before class starts? That's enough time to solve a level or two. Need a mental break during study hall? Sorting some soccer balls is the perfect way to refresh your brain without completely checking out.</p>
                    
                    <p>The satisfaction factor is another huge reason for the game's popularity. There's something genuinely rewarding about transforming a chaotic mix of colors into perfectly organized tubes. It triggers that same part of your brain that enjoys organizing your room or checking items off a to-do list. Combined with the progression system of increasingly difficult levels, each small victory gives you a little dopamine hit that keeps you engaged and coming back for more!</p>
