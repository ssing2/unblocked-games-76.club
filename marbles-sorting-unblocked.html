                    <p class="text-white">
                        <strong>Think Ahead Strategy:</strong> The key to success is planning your moves in advance. Look at the whole puzzle and figure out which marbles need to move first to create space for others. Sometimes you need to temporarily mix colors to create the paths you need.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">
                        <strong>Empty Tube Management:</strong> Empty tubes are your best friends! They're like temporary storage spaces that let you reorganize marbles without getting stuck. Always try to keep at least one tube empty for maneuvering.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">
                        <strong>Color Priority System:</strong> Start by focusing on colors that appear less frequently, as they're usually easier to complete first. This creates more space and makes the remaining colors easier to organize.

                        <li><strong>Start from the bottom:</strong> Always look at which marbles are at the bottom of tubes ‚Äì they determine your available moves</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan reverse moves:</strong> Sometimes you need to move marbles "backwards" to create better sorting opportunities</li>
                        <li><strong>Use the undo wisely:</strong> Don't be afraid to backtrack when you realize you've made a strategic error</li>
                        <li><strong>Pattern recognition:</strong> Learn to spot common sorting patterns that work across multiple levels</li>

                    <p class="text-white">
                        There's something almost magical about the moment when a chaotic mess of mixed marbles suddenly clicks into perfect order. It's like your brain gets this little reward burst every time you successfully sort a tube, and that feeling keeps you coming back for more. Scientists actually call this the "completion effect" ‚Äì our brains are hardwired to find satisfaction in organizing and completing tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">
                        What's really cool is how Marbles Sorting taps into this psychological reward system in the healthiest way possible. Instead of mindless scrolling or random clicking, you're actually exercising your logical thinking skills while getting that same dopamine hit. It's basically brain training disguised as a super fun puzzle game!
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-white mt-4 mb-3">üåà The Beauty of Color Psychology</h2>
                    <p class="text-white">
                        The color combinations in Marbles Sorting aren't just random ‚Äì they're carefully chosen to be visually pleasing and easy to distinguish. Working with colors actually has therapeutic benefits, and many players find that focusing on the beautiful marble designs helps them relax and de-stress after a challenging day.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">
                        Plus, the visual feedback of seeing perfectly organized color groups is incredibly satisfying. It appeals to our natural desire for order and harmony, which is why even people who aren't usually into puzzle games find themselves getting completely absorbed in marble sorting!

                    <p class="text-white">
                        Beyond being incredibly fun, Marbles Sorting actually helps develop skills that are useful in academics. The logical thinking required for solving puzzles translates directly to better problem-solving abilities in math, science, and even essay writing. You're literally making yourself smarter while having a blast!
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white">
                        The game also teaches patience and persistence ‚Äì two qualities that are super valuable in school and life. When you're stuck on a particularly challenging level, you learn to step back, reassess your strategy, and try new approaches. These are exactly the same skills you need when tackling difficult homework or studying for exams.
                    </p>
