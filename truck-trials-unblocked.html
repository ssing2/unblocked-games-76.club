                    <p class="lead mb-4">

                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4">üèÅ Pro Driving Tips & Techniques</h2>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Master the Controls</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Before you start crushing everything in sight, you gotta get comfortable with the controls. Truck Trials uses realistic truck physics, which means you can't just floor it and expect to stay upright. Learn to balance your speed with control - too fast and you'll flip over, too slow and you won't make it over obstacles. Practice smooth acceleration and braking to maintain traction on different surfaces.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Tackle Different Terrains Like a Pro</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Each terrain type requires a different approach. On rocky surfaces, use short bursts of acceleration to maintain grip. When climbing steep hills, keep your momentum steady and avoid sudden movements that could cause you to roll backward. For muddy areas, sometimes you need to build up speed beforehand, but be ready to adjust your steering to prevent sliding sideways.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Perfect Your Jumping Technique</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Jumping is where Truck Trials gets really exciting, but it's also where most players mess up. When approaching a jump, maintain steady speed rather than accelerating at the last second. As you hit the ramp, lean slightly forward to control your landing angle. For longer jumps, you might need to lean back during flight to extend your distance, but always prepare for landing by leveling out your truck.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Vehicle Balance and Weight Distribution</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Understanding how your truck's weight affects performance is crucial. When carrying heavy loads or driving uphill, your acceleration will be slower, but you'll have better traction. Learn to shift your truck's weight by using the tilt controls - this can help you navigate tight spots, maintain balance on uneven terrain, and even recover from potential flips.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Advanced Obstacle Navigation</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The most challenging parts of Truck Trials involve complex obstacle courses. Break down each section into smaller challenges rather than trying to rush through. Look ahead to plan your route, identify the best approach angles, and don't be afraid to take it slow on tricky sections. Sometimes the fastest way through is actually the most careful approach.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Recovery Techniques</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        When things go wrong (and they will), knowing how to recover can save your run. If you're starting to tip over, quick steering adjustments in the opposite direction can sometimes save you. If you get stuck, try rocking back and forth with alternating acceleration and reverse. Learn to recognize when it's better to restart rather than struggling with a damaged truck.
                    </p>
