                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4">üéØ Pro Strategy Tips & Techniques</h2>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Master the Basics First</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Before you start trying to speedrun through games, make sure you've got the fundamentals down solid. Tri Peaks is all about clearing the three "peaks" of cards by finding sequences that go up or down from your current card. The key is understanding that you can go from King to Ace or Ace to King - that's where a lot of beginners get stuck. Practice identifying these sequences quickly, and you'll already be ahead of most players.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Think Several Moves Ahead</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        This is where Tri Peaks gets really strategic. Don't just look at what cards you can play right now - think about what cards those moves will reveal and how they'll affect your future options. Sometimes it's better to skip an obvious move if it's going to block you from making better plays later. This kind of forward thinking is what separates casual players from the pros.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Prioritize Peak Clearing</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Your main goal is to clear all three peaks, but not all peaks are created equal. Focus on the peaks that have fewer cards covered, as these are easier to complete. Once you clear a peak, you get bonus points and often reveal cards that can help you tackle the remaining peaks. It's like solving a puzzle - work on the easiest parts first to give yourself more options.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Manage Your Stock Pile Wisely</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The stock pile is your lifeline when you're stuck, but don't waste it carelessly. Try to use up as many tableau cards as possible before drawing from the stock. When you do draw, look for cards that will open up multiple new possibilities rather than just continuing your current sequence. Smart stock management is often the difference between winning and losing a challenging game.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Look for Long Sequences</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The longer your sequences, the higher your score and the more cards you clear in one go. Always scan the visible cards to see if you can create longer chains. Sometimes you might need to sacrifice a short sequence now to set up a much longer one later. This is advanced strategy, but once you get the hang of it, your scores will skyrocket.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Use the Undo Feature Strategically</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Most versions of Tri Peaks let you undo moves, and this isn't cheating - it's part of the strategy! Use it to experiment with different approaches or to back out of moves that didn't work as planned. Think of it as your safety net while you're learning new strategies or tackling particularly challenging layouts.
