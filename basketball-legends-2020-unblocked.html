                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master the Crossover Dribble</h5>
                        <p>The crossover is your best friend for breaking past defenders. To perform it, quickly tap left-right or right-left (A-D or ←-→) while dribbling. A well-timed crossover can leave your defender frozen while you drive to the hoop for an easy bucket. This move is especially effective with faster characters like the ones based on Kyrie Irving or Russell Westbrook. Practice your timing in the training mode before trying it in actual games – a perfect crossover can make even the best defenders look silly!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Use the Pump Fake to Bait Blocks</h5>
                        <p>Defenders love to jump at the first hint of a shot attempt. Use this eagerness against them by performing a pump fake – tap the shoot button (J or Numpad 1) quickly without holding it. This will make your player go through the beginning of their shooting motion without actually shooting. When the defender jumps to block, they're committed and can't jump again immediately. That's your chance to step around them for an easy shot or drive to the basket. This technique is especially effective in the closing moments of close games when defenders are desperate to make stops.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Don't Waste Your Special Moves</h5>
                        <p>Your special meter fills up as you perform successful actions like scoring, stealing, or blocking shots. When it's full, you can unleash a character-specific special move that's nearly impossible to stop. Rather than using this as soon as it's available, save it for clutch moments when you really need a guaranteed basket. The best times to use your special are when you're down by a few points with time running out, when you need to break a tie late in the game, or when you want to start a comeback. Using a special move at the right moment can completely shift the momentum of a match!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Perfect the Art of Shot Blocking</h5>
                        <p>Defense wins championships, and shot blocking is your primary defensive weapon. The trick to consistent blocks is all about timing – don't jump as soon as your opponent gets the ball. Instead, watch their shooting animation and jump just as they're about to release the ball. Different characters have different shooting animations, so with practice, you'll learn to recognize the perfect moment to jump. Position yourself directly in your opponent's path to maximize your chance of getting the block. A successful block often leads to a fast break opportunity going the other way!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Create Space for Your Jumpshot</h5>
                        <p>While dunking is flashy, consistent jump shooting is the key to winning tight games. To create space for an uncontested jumper, use a combination of crossovers and quick direction changes to make your defender back off. Some characters have much better jump shots than others (looking at you, Curry-inspired character!), so know your player's strengths. When shooting, try to release from the highest point of your jump for the best accuracy. Also, shots taken from your character's favorite spots on the court have a higher chance of going in, so learn those sweet spots!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Master the Alley-Oop in 2v2 Mode</h5>
                        <p>In 2v2 mode, communication with your teammate is key for pulling off the spectacular alley-oop play. To execute this, have one player drive toward the basket while the other gets into position near the hoop. The driving player should press the pass button (K or Numpad 2) when close to the basket, sending the ball high into the air. The receiving player then presses the shoot button (J or Numpad 1) to catch and slam home the alley-oop. This play is difficult to defend and looks awesome when executed properly. Plus, alley-oops fill your special meter faster than regular baskets!</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Sharpshooters</h5>
                        <p>Characters based on Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson fall into this category. These players have exceptional shooting range and accuracy but might lack in defensive capabilities. When using sharpshooters, create space for open jump shots rather than driving to the basket. Their special moves often involve impossible long-range shots that are guaranteed to go in. Keep your distance from defenders and use crossovers to create enough space for your shot. On defense, try to stay in front of your opponent rather than going for blocks, as these characters typically have lower jumping ability.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>All-Around Superstars</h5>
                        <p>Characters inspired by LeBron James and Kevin Durant are balanced players who can do it all. They have good speed, shooting ability, and defensive skills without any major weaknesses. These are perfect characters for beginners because they're versatile enough to adapt to any playstyle. Their special moves are usually powerful dunks that are difficult to block. When using these characters, mix up your play style between outside shooting and driving to the basket to keep defenders guessing. On defense, these players have the height and jumping ability to contest most shots effectively.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Athletic Slashers</h5>
                        <p>Based on players like Russell Westbrook and Ja Morant, these characters excel at driving to the basket with explosive speed and jumping ability. They might not have the best outside shot, but they're nearly unstoppable when attacking the rim. Their special moves often involve high-flying dunks with extraordinary hang time. When using slashers, utilize their speed advantage with quick crossovers followed by drives to the basket. On defense, their quickness makes them excellent at stealing the ball, so time your steal attempts when your opponent is beginning their dribble move.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Defensive Specialists</h5>
                        <p>Characters based on players like Giannis Antetokounmpo and Anthony Davis are defensive powerhouses with shot-blocking ability and strong rebounding skills. They might not be the fastest or have the best outside shot, but they can dominate in the paint on both ends. Their special moves often involve defensive plays like epic blocks or rebounding slams. When using these characters, position yourself near the basket on defense to maximize your shot-blocking effectiveness. On offense, use your height advantage for close-range shots and dunks rather than settling for jump shots.</p>

                        <h5>How do I play 2-player mode with my friend?</h5>
                        <p>Setting up a 2-player game is super easy! From the main menu, select "2P VS" mode. Then each player will choose their character. Player 1 uses the WASD keys for movement and J, K, L for actions, while Player 2 uses arrow keys and Numpad 1, 2, 3 (or M, N, B as alternatives if your keyboard doesn't have a numpad). Once characters are selected, you'll choose a court and then it's game on! Both players share the same keyboard, so make sure you have enough space. This mode is perfect for settling basketball debates with friends during lunch breaks or after school!</p>

                        <h5>How do I perform dunks and special moves?</h5>
                        <p>Dunks happen automatically when you're close to the basket and press the shoot button (J for Player 1, Numpad 1/M for Player 2). To increase your chances of dunking, drive directly toward the basket with some momentum before shooting. As for special moves, each character builds up a special meter by scoring points, blocking shots, and stealing the ball. When the meter is full (you'll see it glowing at the bottom of the screen), press the special move button (L for Player 1, Numpad 3/B for Player 2) to activate your character's unique special ability. Each character has a different special move – some have unstoppable dunks, while others might have guaranteed three-pointers or defensive specials.</p>

                        <h5>Why can't I block the computer's shots?</h5>
                        <p>Blocking in Basketball Legends 2020 is all about timing! If you're struggling to block shots, you're probably jumping too early or too late. Wait until your opponent is at the peak of their shooting motion, then press the block button. Also, make sure you're positioned directly in the path of the shooter – even perfect timing won't work if you're not in the right position. The computer AI on higher difficulties has very good shot timing, making blocks more challenging. With practice, you'll start to recognize the perfect moment to jump for each character's shooting animation. Remember that faster players with higher jumping ability (like those based on Westbrook or Jordan) will have an easier time blocking shots.</p>

                        <h5>How do I unlock all characters?</h5>
                        <p>Most characters are available from the start, but some special or hidden characters might need to be unlocked by completing specific achievements or winning tournaments. The most common ways to unlock characters include: winning the tournament mode with multiple different characters, achieving a certain number of total points across all games, performing a specific number of special moves, or winning by a large margin against higher difficulty AI. Keep playing, and you'll eventually unlock everyone! Some versions of the game might also have secret button combinations at the character select screen that unlock hidden characters instantly.</p>

                        <h5>Does the game save my progress?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! Basketball Legends 2020 automatically saves your progress using your browser's local storage. This includes unlocked characters, your win-loss record, and any achievements you've earned. Just make sure you're not playing in incognito/private browsing mode and haven't cleared your browser cookies recently. If you're playing at school, be aware that some school computers might clear browser data between sessions, which could reset your progress. For the most reliable experience, try to complete tournaments and unlock characters when you're using a personal device where data won't be cleared.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Basketball Legends 2020 Is So Addictive</h4>
                    <p>Basketball Legends 2020 has cracked the code for creating an insanely addictive basketball experience that's hard to put down. One of the biggest reasons is its perfect pacing – games last just 2-3 minutes, making them ideal for quick gaming sessions during school breaks. This "just one more game" format means you can squeeze in matches between classes or during lunch without committing to a lengthy gaming session. Before you know it, you've played ten matches back-to-back!</p>
                    
                    <p>The game also nails the balance between accessibility and depth. Anyone can pick up the basic controls in seconds, but mastering crossovers, pump fakes, and perfect block timing takes practice. This learning curve keeps you engaged as you visibly improve with each game. There's a real satisfaction in pulling off a perfect defensive stop followed by a highlight-worthy dunk that you couldn't have executed when you first started playing.</p>
                    
                    <p>The character roster is another major hook. Playing as cartoon versions of recognizable basketball superstars lets you recreate dream matchups and settle playground debates about who's really the GOAT. Each character's unique abilities and special moves add variety to every match, encouraging you to try different players to find your perfect style. The exaggerated, arcade-style animations make every dunk, block, and special move feel incredibly satisfying – much more spectacular than what you'd see in simulation-style basketball games.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, the local multiplayer mode creates those magical competitive gaming moments that you remember long after the game ends. There's nothing quite like the trash talk, laughter, and excitement of battling a friend sitting right next to you. That buzzer-beater three-pointer to win by one point or that epic block in the final seconds becomes a shared memory and instantly calls for a rematch. It's this social element that elevates Basketball Legends 2020 from a simple time-killer to a genuinely memorable gaming experience.</p>

                    <p>Want to conquer the tournament mode? Here's how:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Choose the Right Character:</strong> Different tournament brackets have different challenges. Sharpshooters work well in tournaments with lots of open courts, while defensive specialists excel in close-quarters competitions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Save Your Energy:</strong> Don't go all-out in early rounds. Win comfortably but conserve energy (and special moves) for the tougher later matches.</li>
                        <li><strong>Study Your Opponents:</strong> Each AI character has tendencies. Some always go for three-pointers, while others constantly drive to the basket. Recognize these patterns and counter them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manage the Clock:</strong> If you're ahead, run down the shot clock on your possessions. If you're behind, play faster and more aggressively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjust to Different Courts:</strong> Some courts have unique elements that affect gameplay. The street court might have different bounces than the professional arena.</li>
                        <li><strong>Practice Free Throws:</strong> In close tournament games, free throws can be the difference between advancing and elimination. The timing is different from regular shots, so practice in training mode.</li>
