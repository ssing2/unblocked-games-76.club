                        Get ready to dive into the most intense traffic management experience that's absolutely blowing up in schools everywhere! Traffic Control isn't just another puzzle game - it's a high-pressure, adrenaline-pumping challenge that puts you in the hot seat as the master of urban traffic flow. Think you can handle the stress when hundreds of cars are depending on your split-second decisions to avoid total chaos?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        What makes Traffic Control so incredibly addictive? It's the perfect storm of strategy, timing, and pure mental agility all rolled into one epic package. You're not just randomly clicking buttons - every single move requires serious brain power as you juggle multiple intersections, coordinate traffic lights, and prevent those heart-stopping near-miss moments that'll have you on the edge of your seat. The realistic traffic simulation combined with increasingly challenging scenarios creates an experience that's both educational and totally mind-blowing.

                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4">🎮 How to Play Traffic Control</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        New to traffic management? Don't sweat it! Here's how to get started with Traffic Control:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ol class="text-white mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Control Traffic Lights:</strong> Click on intersections to change traffic light patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor Traffic Flow:</strong> Watch for buildups and congestion across all lanes</li>
                        <li><strong>Prevent Accidents:</strong> Keep traffic moving smoothly to avoid collisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Handle Emergencies:</strong> Give priority to emergency vehicles when they appear</li>
                        <li><strong>Complete Objectives:</strong> Each level has specific goals to achieve before time runs out</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The controls are super intuitive - just click or tap on intersections to change the traffic lights. The real challenge comes from making the right decisions at the right time. Remember, a small traffic jam can quickly spiral into complete gridlock if you don't address it quickly!
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4">🎯 Pro Traffic Management Strategies</h2>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Master the Art of Prediction</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The biggest secret to crushing Traffic Control is learning to think ahead - way ahead. Don't just focus on the cars that are right at your intersection. You need to be scanning the entire screen, watching for incoming traffic, and predicting where bottlenecks are going to form before they actually happen. The best players can see patterns developing and adjust their strategy to prevent problems that most people don't even notice until it's too late.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Perfect Your Light Timing</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Traffic light timing is literally everything in this game, and it's where most beginners totally crash and burn. You can't just flip lights randomly and hope for the best. Learn to read the traffic density in each direction and give longer green lights to the heavier flows. But here's the pro tip: always leave a little buffer time between switches to avoid trapping cars in the middle of intersections.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Handle Rush Hour Like a Boss</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        When the traffic gets absolutely insane (and trust me, it will), you need to switch into crisis management mode. Forget about trying to optimize every single car's journey - focus on maintaining steady flow and preventing gridlock. Sometimes you gotta sacrifice efficiency for stability, letting one direction build up a bit while you clear a massive jam in another direction.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Emergency Vehicle Priority System</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Emergency vehicles are game-changers that'll test your ability to adapt under pressure. The moment you spot an ambulance or fire truck, everything else becomes secondary. Clear their path immediately, even if it means disrupting your perfectly timed traffic flow. Pro players anticipate emergency vehicles and start clearing paths before they even reach the intersection.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Multi-Intersection Coordination</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Advanced levels throw multiple intersections at you, and this is where Traffic Control gets seriously complex. You need to think about how your decisions at one intersection affect traffic flow at others. Creating green waves - where cars can flow through multiple lights without stopping - is the ultimate skill that separates casual players from true traffic management legends.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Read the Traffic Patterns</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Every level has its own unique traffic personality. Some have steady flows, others have sudden bursts, and some are just pure chaos from start to finish. Spend the first few seconds of each level just observing the patterns before you start making major changes. Understanding the rhythm of each level is key to developing a winning strategy.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Stay Cool Under Pressure</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        When everything starts going wrong (and it will), the worst thing you can do is panic and start randomly clicking everything. Take a deep breath, assess which intersection needs the most immediate attention, and tackle problems one at a time. Sometimes the best move is to let a small backup happen while you focus on preventing a much bigger disaster.
                    </p>

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            Traffic Control is even more fun when you compete with friends! Challenge your classmates to see who can:

                        <p>Traffic Control starts with simple single-intersection scenarios but eventually challenges you with complex multi-intersection networks, rush hour traffic, and emergency situations that would stress out real traffic controllers!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="mb-4">

                        <p>Minor jams are part of the challenge, but if you create a massive gridlock or cause accidents, the level ends. Don't worry though - you can restart immediately and apply what you learned from the failure.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="mb-4">

                    </div>

                    <div class="mb-4">
                        <h4 class="text-white mb-2">Is there a scoring system?</h4>
