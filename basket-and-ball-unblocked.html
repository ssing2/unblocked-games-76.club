                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Tips and Strategies</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Study the Entire Level Before Shooting</h5>
                        <p>The biggest mistake new players make is rushing their first shot without fully understanding the level. Take a moment to observe all the elements in play – moving platforms, obstacles, buttons, trampolines, etc. Understanding how these pieces interact will help you formulate a strategy before wasting shots. Think of it like a basketball player studying the defense before making a move. Sometimes the obvious path to the basket isn't the best one!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Master the Power Control</h5>
                        <p>Power control is absolutely crucial in Basket And Ball. Pulling back further increases shot power, but more power isn't always better! Many puzzles require gentle, controlled shots rather than full-power launches. Practice getting a feel for different power levels and how they affect the ball's trajectory. For precision shots, try pulling back just a tiny bit for minimum power – this is often the key to navigating tight spaces or making small adjustments to objects.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Use Bounces to Your Advantage</h5>
                        <p>The ball bounces realistically off surfaces, and learning to use these bounces strategically is a game-changer. Instead of trying to avoid walls, sometimes the best solution involves intentionally bouncing off them at specific angles. Look for opportunities to use multiple bounces to reach difficult areas or to generate momentum. Think like a pool player calculating bank shots – sometimes the indirect path is the perfect solution!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Timing Is Everything for Moving Parts</h5>
                        <p>Many levels feature moving platforms, rotating obstacles, or other dynamic elements that follow specific patterns. Take time to observe these patterns before shooting. The key is patience – wait for the perfect moment when platforms align or when a gap opens up. Don't rush your shot just because an opportunity appears; make sure you'll have a clear path all the way to the basket. Sometimes waiting just one more second makes the difference between success and failure!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Experiment with Interactive Elements</h5>
                        <p>Don't be afraid to click on different objects in the level – many elements are interactive in ways that might not be immediately obvious. Some platforms can be moved or rotated, buttons can activate mechanisms, and certain obstacles can be eliminated. If you're stuck, try clicking around to see what you can manipulate. The solution often involves using these interactive elements in creative ways to create a path for your ball.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Use the Trajectory Guide Wisely</h5>
                        <p>The trajectory line shows you the initial path of your shot, but it doesn't account for bounces or interactions with objects. Use it as a starting point, but visualize in your mind how the ball will continue after the line ends. With practice, you'll get better at predicting complex bounces and ricochets. For precision shots, pay attention to the exact endpoint of the trajectory line – even small adjustments can significantly change where the ball ends up.</p>

                        <h5>Beginner Levels (1-20)</h5>
                        <p>The early levels introduce basic concepts with straightforward shots and minimal obstacles. These are perfect for getting comfortable with the controls and understanding the core physics of the game. You'll encounter simple walls, basic platforms, and easy basket placements. Even though these levels seem easy, try to complete them with as few shots as possible to earn all three stars. These levels are like learning to dribble before attempting fancy moves!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Intermediate Challenges (21-50)</h5>
                        <p>As you progress, the game introduces more complex elements like moving platforms, bounce pads, and simple switches or buttons. These levels require more planning and precise timing. You'll start to encounter situations where you need to activate mechanisms in a specific sequence or use momentum creatively. The direct path to the basket is often blocked, forcing you to find clever indirect routes. These levels test your problem-solving skills as much as your shooting accuracy.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Advanced Puzzles (51-80)</h5>
                        <p>Advanced levels combine multiple mechanics and require sophisticated strategies. You'll face moving obstacles that must be avoided, timed sequences requiring perfect execution, and puzzles with multiple steps.

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>I'm completely stuck on a level. Any hints?</h5>
                        <p>If you're stuck, first make sure you've explored all interactive elements in the level – try clicking on different objects to see what can be manipulated. Consider approaches that might seem counter-intuitive, like intentionally bouncing off walls or using minimal power. Sometimes the solution involves setting up a chain reaction rather than scoring directly. If a level seems impossible, take a break and come back later with fresh eyes – the solution often becomes obvious when you're not overthinking it. As a last resort, you can find walkthrough videos online for particularly challenging levels.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I earn three stars on each level?</h5>
                        <p>Star ratings typically depend on how efficiently you complete the level. In most cases, this means using the minimum number of shots (often just one perfect shot). Some levels may also factor in the time taken or whether you activated certain bonus elements. If you're struggling to get three stars, focus on finding the most direct path to the basket and perfecting your shot power and angle. Don't be afraid to restart if your first attempt isn't perfect – practice makes perfect! Remember that you can always come back to previous levels after you've mastered the mechanics.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Does the game save my progress automatically?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! Basket And Ball automatically saves your progress using your browser's local storage. You can close the game and return later to pick up where you left off. Just make sure you're using the same browser and haven't cleared your browsing data. If you're playing at school, be aware that some school computers might clear browser data between sessions, so your progress could be reset. For the best experience, try to complete sets of levels in one session when possible.</p>

                        <h5>Are there any hidden features or secret levels?</h5>
                        <p>Some versions of Basket And Ball include bonus levels that can be unlocked by earning a certain number of stars or by finding hidden objects within regular levels. Look for clickable items that seem out of place or areas of the screen that might be interactive outside the main puzzle. The game may also feature special themed levels during holidays or after major updates. These secret levels often feature unique mechanics or especially challenging designs that provide a fresh experience for players who have mastered the main game.</p>

                        <h5>Why does the physics sometimes feel different between levels?</h5>
                        <p>This is actually by design! Different levels might subtly adjust physics parameters to create specific challenges. Some levels might have slightly higher gravity, different bounce elasticity, or altered friction. These variations keep the gameplay fresh and force you to adapt your strategy. Part of mastering Basket And Ball is quickly getting a feel for the specific physics of each level through observation and experimentation. This design choice adds depth to the game by preventing you from using exactly the same approach on every level.</p>

The one-touch control scheme is super easy to learn – anyone can pick up the game and understand the basic goal within seconds. But beneath this simple surface lies a world of complex physics interactions and clever puzzle design that keeps your brain engaged for hours. It's this combination of accessibility and challenge that makes the game so hard to put down.</p>
                    
                    <p>The satisfaction factor is another huge reason for the game's addictiveness. There's something incredibly rewarding about watching your perfectly aimed shot navigate through a complex series of obstacles and swish cleanly through the basket. That moment of triumph after solving a particularly difficult level triggers a dopamine release that keeps you coming back for more. It's the same feeling that makes real basketball so engaging – the perfect shot just feels good!</p>
                    
                    <p>The level progression is masterfully designed to create a "flow state" – that sweet spot where challenges match your growing skills. Early levels build your confidence while teaching core mechanics, and difficulty increases at just the right pace to keep you engaged without becoming frustrating. This careful balancing act keeps you in that "just one more level" mindset, where you're always excited to see what new challenge awaits.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Basket And Ball respects your intelligence by letting you discover solutions rather than holding your hand. When you finally solve a tough level, the victory feels earned because you figured it out yourself. This sense of accomplishment is far more satisfying than games that guide you through every step, and it creates a stronger connection between player and game that keeps you invested in your progress.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3">Brain Benefits of Playing</h4>
                    <p>Basket And Ball isn't just fun – it actually exercises your brain in several ways:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Spatial Reasoning:</strong> Visualizing trajectories and predicting how objects will interact improves spatial intelligence</li>
                        <li><strong>Physics Intuition:</strong> Playing regularly builds an intuitive understanding of momentum, angles, and energy transfer</li>
                        <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Each level is essentially a puzzle requiring creative solutions and logical thinking</li>
                        <li><strong>Planning Skills:</strong> Many levels require multi-step solutions that must be planned in advance</li>
                        <li><strong>Patience & Persistence:</strong> Challenging levels teach the value of trying different approaches and not giving up</li>
                        <li><strong>Fine Motor Control:</strong> Precise aiming and power control improve hand-eye coordination</li>
                        <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identifying recurring elements and mechanics helps you solve puzzles more efficiently</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>So next time someone says you're "just playing games," tell them you're actually strengthening neural pathways and developing valuable cognitive skills!</p>
