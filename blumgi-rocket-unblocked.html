                    <h4 class="mb-3">How to Play</h4>
                    <p>Blumgi Rocket features super simple controls that are easy to learn but challenging to master:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Activate Rocket:</strong> Press and hold the left mouse button, spacebar, or touch the screen</li>
                        <li><strong>Release Rocket:</strong> Let go of the button/screen to cut engine power</li>
                        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Your character moves in the direction the rocket is pointing</li>
                        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Navigate from the starting point to the finish portal in each level</li>
                        <li><strong>Stars:</strong> Collect the three stars in each level for perfect completion</li>
                        <li><strong>Obstacles:</strong> Avoid hitting walls, spikes, and other hazards that will end your flight</li>
                        <li><strong>Power-ups:</strong> Grab special items that give you temporary abilities like shields or speed boosts</li>
                        <li><strong>Checkpoints:</strong> Some levels have checkpoints that save your progress mid-level</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The key to success is mastering the delicate balance between rocket power and gravity. Short, controlled bursts often work better than holding the rocket continuously!</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Pro Flying Techniques</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master the Pulse Technique</h5>
                        <p>Instead of holding your rocket button continuously, learn to "pulse" it with short, controlled bursts. This technique gives you much more precise control over your flight path. Tap quickly to maintain a steady altitude, tap harder for quick ascents, or let gravity pull you down for controlled descents. The rhythm of your tapping creates different flight patterns – rapid tapping for hovering, longer presses for climbing, and complete release for dropping. Practice this pulsing technique on the early levels until it becomes second nature. Pro players can navigate even the tightest spaces using perfectly timed pulses rather than erratic rocket blasts.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Use Momentum to Your Advantage</h5>
                        <p>Understanding momentum is crucial for advanced flying. Your Blumgi character maintains momentum even when the rocket isn't firing, which can be used to glide through sections efficiently. Build up speed with your rocket, then release at the perfect moment to arc gracefully through star patterns or over obstacles. This conserves fuel and gives you more controlled movement than constant propulsion. For long horizontal sections, use a pattern of boost-glide-boost-glide rather than continuous power. When approaching a ceiling or narrow passage, cut your rocket early to avoid crashing from excess momentum.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Plan Your Approach Angles</h5>
                        <p>The angle at which you approach obstacles and collectibles can make a huge difference. Try to position yourself so that your natural flight arc aligns with the path of stars or the entrance to tight spaces. Sometimes it's better to take a slightly longer route if it gives you a more favorable angle of approach. When collecting a vertical line of stars, approach from below with steady upward momentum rather than trying to adjust mid-flight. For tight passages, align yourself parallel to the passage before entering rather than trying to correct your angle while inside. Remember that changing direction takes time – plan your angles well in advance of obstacles.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Master the Ceiling Slide</h5>
                        <p>One advanced technique that separates pros from amateurs is the "ceiling slide." When you need to navigate a low ceiling area, fly up to the ceiling and then use very short, gentle pulses to slide along it without bouncing off. This technique gives you incredible control in areas where vertical space is limited. The trick is to apply just enough rocket power to counteract gravity without pushing yourself away from the ceiling. It takes practice to get the pulse timing just right, but once mastered, you can zip along ceilings through sections that seem impossible to navigate normally. This technique is especially useful in later levels where low clearance areas are common.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Use Environmental Features</h5>
                        <p>As you progress, you'll encounter various environmental elements that can either help or hinder your flight. Learn to use these to your advantage! Wind tunnels can propel you without using rocket power – align yourself properly before entering to maximize their boost. Bounce pads can launch you in specific directions without rocket fuel – time your approach to hit them at optimal angles. Some surfaces have different properties – ice reduces friction for faster horizontal movement, while sticky surfaces can help you make precise landings. Study each new environmental feature when you first encounter it and experiment with how it affects your flight dynamics.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Develop Level-Specific Strategies</h5>
                        <p>Don't approach every level with the same strategy. Each level in Blumgi Rocket is designed with specific challenges in mind and might require unique approaches. Some levels are best completed with careful, slow navigation, while others reward speed and momentum. Before attempting a difficult section, take a moment to observe the layout and plan your route. Look for alternative paths that might be less obvious but easier to navigate. Pay attention to star placements – they often hint at the intended flight path. When you fail a level, don't just retry blindly – analyze what went wrong and adjust your approach. The most efficient path isn't always the most obvious one!</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Starter World</h5>
                        <p>The first set of levels serves as your introduction to Blumgi Rocket's physics and controls. These beginner-friendly stages feature simple layouts with wide-open spaces, generous star placements, and minimal hazards. Use these levels to practice basic rocket control and get a feel for how momentum works in the game. Focus on smooth landings and controlled flight rather than speed. Even though these levels are easier, try to collect all three stars to develop good habits early. The starter world might seem too easy for experienced gamers, but it builds the foundation of skills you'll need for the significantly tougher challenges ahead.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Cave World</h5>
                        <p>As you progress, you'll enter cave-themed levels featuring tighter spaces, more obstacles, and trickier star placements. These levels test your precision flying skills and ability to navigate confined areas. The cave world introduces new hazards like stalactites and stalagmites that require careful maneuvering. You'll need to master the pulse technique to avoid hitting the ceiling or floor in narrow passages. Momentum management becomes crucial here – too much speed will send you crashing into walls. These levels also begin introducing environmental elements like bounce pads and moving platforms. Patient, controlled flying is rewarded over reckless speed in the cave world.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Industrial World</h5>
                        <p>The industrial-themed levels crank up the challenge with mechanical hazards and timing-based obstacles. You'll encounter moving saw blades, crushing pistons, timed doors, and conveyor belts that affect your movement. These levels require not just flying skill but precise timing and quick reactions. The industrial world often features more complex level designs with multiple possible paths and hidden areas containing bonus stars or power-ups. The difficulty spike here is significant – expect to retry levels multiple times as you learn the patterns of moving obstacles. Success depends on combining your flying techniques with an understanding of each obstacle's timing.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Extreme Challenge World</h5>
                        <p>For those who master the earlier worlds, the extreme challenges await. These levels combine all previous elements with even tighter margins for error, more complex obstacle arrangements, and star placements that require pixel-perfect flying. New challenges like gravity flips, wind currents, and disappearing platforms test even veteran players. These levels often require specific strategies and approaches – brute-forcing your way through rarely works. Some extreme levels have hidden shortcuts or alternative routes that make seemingly impossible challenges more manageable. Completing these levels with all stars is a true badge of honor that only the most skilled Blumgi pilots can achieve!</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I unlock new characters in Blumgi Rocket?</h5>
                        <p>New characters are typically unlocked through one of three methods, depending on the version of the game you're playing. The most common way is by collecting a certain number of stars across all levels – for example, you might need 50 stars to unlock the second character and 100 for the third. Some characters might be unlocked by completing specific achievement challenges, like finishing a certain number of levels without crashing or collecting all stars in a particular world. In some versions, characters can also be unlocked by collecting special tokens hidden in certain levels. Each character usually has slightly different physics properties – some might have stronger rocket thrust but less control, while others might be slower but more precise. Experiment with different characters to find one that matches your playing style!</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>I keep crashing into obstacles. Any tips for better control?</h5>
                        <p>Crashing is part of the learning process in Blumgi Rocket, but there are definitely ways to improve your control! First, try using shorter rocket bursts instead of holding the button down continuously. This "pulse" technique gives you much more precise control. Second, remember that your character has momentum – if you're moving fast, you'll need to start slowing down well before reaching an obstacle. Third, try to maintain a moderate speed in areas with lots of obstacles rather than going full throttle. Fourth, pay attention to your approach angles – it's often easier to navigate through tight spaces if you're already aligned properly before you reach them. Finally, practice makes perfect! The physics in this game are consistent, so the more you play, the better your muscle memory becomes for controlling your flight path.</p>

                        <h5>What's the best way to collect all three stars in difficult levels?</h5>
                        <p>Collecting all three stars on challenging levels requires strategy! First, don't try to get all stars on your first attempt – focus on learning the level layout and obstacles. Once you're familiar with the level, plan a specific route that passes through all stars with the most efficient path. Sometimes it's better to collect stars in a different order than they appear. Use environmental features like bounce pads or wind tunnels to reach awkwardly placed stars without precise rocket control. For stars in tight spaces, approach slowly with controlled pulses rather than rushing in. Sometimes it's worth taking a slightly longer route if it gives you better angles for star collection. And don't forget about character selection – some characters have abilities that make certain star configurations easier to collect. If a particular star seems impossible to reach, look for hidden alternative approaches!</p>

                        <h5>How do power-ups work in the game?</h5>
                        <p>Power-ups add an extra layer of strategy to your flights! The most common power-ups include: Shield, which protects you from one collision with an obstacle; Rocket Boost, which gives you temporary unlimited fuel for continuous flight; Star Magnet, which attracts nearby stars to your character; Time Slow, which reduces the speed of moving obstacles; and Miniaturize, which shrinks your character to fit through tight spaces. Power-ups are typically collected by flying through their icons in the level, and they activate either immediately or when you press a specific button (depending on the game version). Some power-ups have limited duration, shown by a timer or visual effect. Strategic use of power-ups can make seemingly impossible sections much more manageable, so don't waste them! Save shields for areas with dense obstacles, and use rocket boosts for long sections where precise control is less critical.</p>

                        <h5>Does the game save my progress automatically?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! Blumgi Rocket automatically saves your progress as you complete levels and collect stars. The game uses your browser's local storage to remember which levels you've unlocked, which stars you've collected, and which characters you've unlocked. You can safely close the game and return later to continue your progress. However, if you're playing on a school or public computer, be aware that your progress might be reset if the browser data is cleared between sessions. For the most reliable experience, try to complete world sets in one sitting when using shared computers. If you're really invested in the game, consider playing on a personal device where your progress won't be cleared. Some versions of the game might also have cloud saving features or account systems for cross-device progress, though this varies between implementations.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Blumgi Rocket Is So Addictive</h4>
                    <p>Blumgi Rocket hooks players with its perfect balance of simplicity and challenge. The one-touch control scheme means anyone can pick up and play instantly, but the physics-based gameplay ensures there's always room to improve your skills. This accessibility combined with a high skill ceiling creates that "easy to learn, hard to master" quality that defines the most addictive games.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game's short, bite-sized levels are perfectly designed for the school environment. Each level can be completed in under a minute (if you're skilled enough!), making it ideal for quick gaming sessions between classes or during short breaks. Yet despite these brief levels, there's a satisfying sense of progression as you unlock new worlds, characters, and face increasingly complex challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>The star collection system adds another layer of replayability. While simply reaching the exit portal completes a level, the drive to collect all three stars encourages players to perfect their flight paths and develop better control. This optional challenge system lets casual players enjoy the game at their own pace while giving completionists something to strive for.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Blumgi Rocket has mastered the "just one more try" factor that keeps players coming back. When you crash, it's almost always clear why it happened and how you could avoid it next time. This creates a strong feedback loop where each failure feels like a learning opportunity rather than a frustration. Combined with instant restarts and that constant sense that you could do better with just one more attempt, it's no wonder players find themselves launching their Blumgi character "just one more time" until they suddenly realize they've been playing for hours!</p>

                        <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identifying obstacle patterns and optimal paths trains your brain to spot patterns</li>
                        <li><strong>Patience and Persistence:</strong> Challenging levels teach the value of continued effort despite failures</li>
                        <li><strong>Planning and Strategy:</strong> Mapping efficient routes through complex levels develops planning skills</li>
                        <li><strong>Quick Decision Making:</strong> Reacting to unexpected obstacles improves your reaction time</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Controlling rocket power efficiently is essentially a resource management skill</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>So next time someone says you're "just playing games," tell them you're actually developing important cognitive and motor skills!</p>
