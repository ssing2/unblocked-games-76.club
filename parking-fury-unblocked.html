                    <p class="lead">
                        Yo, think parking is easy? Think again! Parking Fury is here to prove that squeezing a car into a tight spot is way harder than it looks. This isn't just some casual driving game - it's a precision challenge that'll test your spatial awareness, patience, and driving skills like nothing else. Get ready to become a parking master or get absolutely furious trying!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Picture this: you're faced with the most insane parking scenarios imaginable. Tight spaces between cars, crazy angles, obstacles everywhere, and sometimes you've got to park multiple cars without hitting anything. It sounds simple until you're trying to squeeze a sedan into a spot that looks barely big enough for a bicycle! That's when the "fury" part really kicks in.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Master the Art of Precision Parking</h2>
                    <p>
                        Alright, so here's where things get interesting. The controls are pretty straightforward - arrow keys or WASD to drive - but mastering them in these tight spaces? That's a whole different story! You'll need to learn how to inch forward, reverse slowly, and make tiny adjustments that would make a professional driver proud.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Each level throws a new parking nightmare at you. Maybe you need to park in a garage with pillars everywhere, or squeeze between two cars with millimeters to spare, or even park on a slope without rolling into traffic. The game starts easy enough, but by level 10, you'll be questioning your ability to drive in real life!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pro tip: Don't rush! I know it's tempting to just gun it into the parking spot, but slow and steady wins the race here. Take your time to line up your approach, and use those small movements to get the perfect position. Trust me, patience beats speed every time in Parking Fury!
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">What Makes Parking Fury So Addictively Challenging</h2>
                    <div class="row mt-4">
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <h3>üöó Realistic Car Physics</h3>
                            <p>The cars handle just like real vehicles! You'll need to account for turning radius, momentum, and the fact that cars don't stop on a dime.</p>
                            
                            <h3>üéØ Precision Requirements</h3>
                            <p>Every level demands millimeter-perfect positioning. You can't just get "close enough" - you need to nail the exact spot or start over!</p>
                            
                            <h3>üèóÔ∏è Creative Level Design</h3>
                            <p>From simple parallel parking to complex multi-car scenarios, each level brings a new challenge that'll make you think differently about space and movement.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <h3>‚è∞ No Time Pressure</h3>
                            <p>Take as long as you need! There's no timer rushing you, so you can focus on getting that perfect park without the stress of a countdown.</p>
                            
                            <h3>üìà Progressive Difficulty</h3>
                            <p>Starts with basic parking and gradually introduces more complex scenarios, obstacles, and tighter spaces that'll really test your skills.</p>
                            
                            <h3>üéÆ Simple but Deep</h3>
                            <p>Easy to understand controls but incredibly challenging to master. The perfect example of "easy to learn, hard to master" game design!</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Pro Parking Techniques</h2>
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li><strong>üîÑ Use Reference Points:</strong> Line up your car with visual markers like other cars, lines, or objects to help judge distances and angles perfectly.</li>
                        <li><strong>‚ö° Master Reverse Parking:</strong> Sometimes backing into a spot gives you better control and visibility. Don't be afraid to use reverse as your primary approach!</li>
                        <li><strong>üëÅÔ∏è Check All Angles:</strong> Use your mirrors (the camera angles) to see how close you are to obstacles. Every pixel counts in tight spaces!</li>
                        <li><strong>üéØ Plan Your Approach:</strong> Before moving, study the level and plan your route. Sometimes the obvious path isn't the best one.</li>
                        <li><strong>üõë Use Micro-Movements:</strong> Tiny taps on the keys for small adjustments are often more effective than holding down the movement keys.</li>
                        <li><strong>üîß Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> Don't get discouraged by failed attempts! Each try teaches you something new about the level's challenges.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="mt-4">
                        <h3>üÖøÔ∏è Parallel Parking</h3>
                        <p>The classic nightmare! Squeeze your car between two others on a busy street. Requires perfect judgment of space and angles.</p>
                        
                        <h3>üè¢ Garage Parking</h3>
                        <p>Navigate through tight garage spaces with pillars, low ceilings, and multiple obstacles. It's like a maze with your car!</p>
                        
                        <h3>üìê Angle Parking</h3>
                        <p>Park at specific angles in diagonal spots. Sounds easy until you realize how precise your positioning needs to be!</p>
                        
                        <h3>üöô Multi-Car Scenarios</h3>
                        <p>Some levels require you to park multiple vehicles! Each car has different handling, making these levels seriously challenging.</p>
                        
                        <h3>üèîÔ∏è Obstacle Courses</h3>
                        <p>Navigate through cones, barriers, and other cars to reach your parking spot. One wrong move and you'll have to start over!</p>
                        
                        <h3>‚õ∞Ô∏è Slope Parking</h3>
                        <p>Park on hills and inclines where gravity works against you. These levels add a whole new dimension to the challenge!</p>

                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Not at all! While real driving experience might help you understand car movement, the game teaches you everything through its progressive difficulty. Start with the easy levels and work your way up!</p>
                        
                        <h3>Q: What happens if I hit something?</h3>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> You'll usually have to restart the level! The game is pretty strict about collisions, which makes successfully completing levels even more satisfying.</p>

                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Parking Fury has tons of levels that progressively get more challenging. You'll start feeling confident after the first few, then the game will humble you real quick!</p>
                        
                        <h3>Q: Can I skip difficult levels?</h3>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Usually you need to complete levels in order to unlock the next ones. But that's part of the fun - conquering each challenge builds your skills for the next one!</p>
                        
                        <h3>Q: Is there a time limit?</h3>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Nope! Take all the time you need to line up the perfect park. The pressure comes from the precision required, not from any timer.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Q: Why is this game so addictive?</h3>

                        <h3>Q: Will this game help me with real-world parking?</h3>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Actually, yes! The spatial awareness and precision skills you develop can definitely transfer to real driving situations. Plus, you'll appreciate how much easier real parking spots are!</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Why Parking Fury is the Ultimate Test</h2>
                    <p>
                        Look, anyone can drive fast in a racing game or shoot things in an action game, but parking? That requires real skill, patience, and precision. Parking Fury takes something we all have to do in real life and turns it into an art form. It's like the developers looked at the most stressful part of driving and said, "Let's make this into a game!"
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        What makes this game so brilliant is how it captures that real-world frustration of trying to park in a tight spot, but in a fun way. Every time you nudge that bumper or scratch against a wall, you feel that same "ARGH!" moment you get in real life, but then you can just hit restart and try again. It's therapeutic in the weirdest way possible.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The progression in difficulty is absolutely perfect too. You'll start feeling like a parking expert after the first few levels, then BAM - the game throws you a curveball that makes you question everything you thought you knew about spatial awareness. But that's what keeps you coming back for more!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        So fire up Parking Fury and see if you've got what it takes to master the art of precision parking! Fair warning though - this game might make you way more critical of your real-world parking skills. Don't blame us when you start obsessing over being perfectly centered between the lines in every parking lot!
