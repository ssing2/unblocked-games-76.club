                    <h4 class="mb-3">How to Play</h4>
                    <p>Bomb It 7 uses the same intuitive controls as previous games in the series:</p>
                    
                    <h5>Player 1:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)</li>
                        <li><strong>Drop Bomb:</strong> Spacebar</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Ability:</strong> Shift (varies by character)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>Player 2:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> WASD keys (W=up, A=left, S=down, D=right)</li>
                        <li><strong>Drop Bomb:</strong> F</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Ability:</strong> G (varies by character)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The goal remains the classic Bomb It objective: be the last player standing! Move strategically around the arena, drop bombs to destroy obstacles and opponents, and collect power-ups to gain advantages. Each match is fast-paced and typically lasts 2-3 minutes, making it perfect for quick gaming sessions.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Advanced Bombing Strategies</h4>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>1. Master Character-Specific Abilities</h5>
                        <p>The biggest game-changer in Bomb It 7 is the unique character abilities that weren't in earlier versions. Each character has a special move that can completely change how you approach the game. For example, the ninja character can teleport short distances (perfect for escaping tight spots), the robot can temporarily shield itself from explosions, and the ghost can phase through walls for a limited time. Before jumping into matches, spend time in practice mode learning each character's ability and when to best use it. The key is using these abilities at strategic moments rather than as soon as they're available. For instance, save teleportation for when you're cornered rather than using it just to move around. Some abilities even combine well with specific power-ups – like using the freeze ability to hold enemies in place while you set up a bomb trap. Pro players often choose characters based on the arena layout, as some abilities are more valuable in certain environments.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>2. Weaponize the New Environmental Hazards</h5>
                        <p>Bomb It 7 introduces dynamic environmental elements that can be used to your advantage if you're clever. Many arenas now feature moving platforms, teleporters, conveyor belts, and even destructible terrain that changes throughout the match. Instead of avoiding these elements, incorporate them into your strategy! For example, place bombs near cracked floor tiles to create pitfalls for opponents. Time your movements with moving platforms to reach areas other players can't access. Some maps have triggers that activate hazards – lure opponents near these then activate them for easy eliminations. In ice-themed arenas, bombs will slide across slippery surfaces, creating unpredictable explosion patterns that can catch everyone off guard. The most skilled players don't just adapt to these environmental changes – they actively use them as weapons and shields. Remember that environmental hazards affect everyone equally, so staying aware of your surroundings is crucial.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>3. Develop Advanced Trap Techniques</h5>
                        <p>With the expanded bomb types in Bomb It 7, trap-setting has become an art form. Beyond the basic "corner trap," try the "sandwich trap" by placing bombs on both sides of a narrow passage just as an opponent enters. The "countdown trap" involves placing bombs with different fuse lengths in a pattern so they explode in sequence, making escape nearly impossible as each explosion pushes the opponent into the next one. If you've collected the bomb-kicking power-up, you can create "moving traps" by kicking bombs toward areas where opponents are headed. The "fake retreat" is a psychological trap where you appear to flee from an opponent, dropping bombs along your escape route, then suddenly turning back – most players will chase you right into your explosive trail. In team battles, coordinate with teammates to create "crossfire traps" where you attack from multiple angles simultaneously. Remember that the best traps don't look like traps until it's too late!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>4. Optimize Power-Up Combinations</h5>
                        <p>Bomb It 7 introduces new power-up combinations that can create devastatingly effective strategies when used together. The "remote detonator" combined with "bomb pass" allows you to place bombs, walk through them to position them perfectly, then trigger them exactly when needed. Pairing "speed boost" with "bomb kick" creates a highly mobile playstyle where you can quickly reposition bombs across the arena. The new "ghost bomb" power-up (which creates explosions that pass through soft walls) combined with "fire up" can clear entire sections of the map while maintaining cover for yourself. Some power-ups have synergies with specific character abilities – like the rabbit character's high jump combined with the "bomb throw" power-up allows you to place bombs in otherwise unreachable areas. Power-up management is crucial – sometimes it's better to leave certain power-ups uncollected if they don't fit your strategy, preventing opponents from getting them while sticking to your optimal build.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>5. Implement Team Battle Tactics</h5>
                        <p>The new Team Battle mode in Bomb It 7 requires completely different strategies than free-for-all matches. Communication and role assignment are key – typically, teams should have at least one "trapper" who focuses on area denial and one "rusher" who aggressively pursues opponents. Coordinate bomb placements to create inescapable cross-patterns where opponents are caught between multiple explosions. Use the "shield wall" tactic where one player with the bomb-shield power-up acts as a front-line tank while teammates place bombs from safety. The "bait and switch" strategy involves one player drawing attention while their teammate sneaks behind opponents for surprise eliminations. Some character combinations have special synergies – like pairing a character who can freeze opponents with one who has high bomb capacity for maximum damage. Remember that in team mode, you can't harm teammates with explosions, so don't be afraid to bomb an area where your ally is fighting – you'll only hurt the enemies!</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>6. Adapt to Arena-Specific Strategies</h5>
                        <p>Each arena in Bomb It 7 requires different approaches for maximum success. In the Factory arena, timing is everything – learn the patterns of moving machinery and use them to trap opponents or protect yourself. The Ancient Temple features teleporters that can instantly transport you across the map – memorize their connections to escape tight situations or surprise opponents. The Space Station has low gravity zones where bombs and players float slowly – use this to create aerial traps that are difficult to escape. The Volcano arena gradually fills with lava, forcing players to higher ground – control the top platforms early to dominate late-game. The Winter Wonderland has ice that affects movement and bomb sliding – use the slippery surfaces to extend your bomb placement range. Don't apply the same strategy to every arena! Watch the opening animation when each level loads, as it often highlights the unique features of that environment. The most adaptable players often win more consistently than those with a single, inflexible strategy.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Classic Bomber (Red)</h5>
                        <p>The well-rounded original character remains a solid choice for beginners and veterans alike. With balanced stats across the board, Classic Bomber doesn't excel in any particular area but has no significant weaknesses either. His special ability is a temporary speed boost that helps with both aggressive pushes and quick escapes. This versatility makes him perfect for players still learning the game or those who prefer an adaptable playstyle. Classic Bomber works well in any arena and any game mode, making him the perfect "all-situations" choice. If you're new to Bomb It 7, starting with Classic Bomber lets you focus on core mechanics before experimenting with more specialized characters. His balanced nature also makes him a reliable team player in multiplayer matches.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Shadow Ninja (Black)</h5>
                        <p>A fan favorite from previous games returns with a powerful teleportation ability that can phase through walls and bombs for a short distance. Shadow Ninja trades bomb power for exceptional mobility, making him perfect for players who prioritize positioning and surprise attacks. His bombs have slightly smaller blast radius than average, but he can place them with surgical precision thanks to his teleport. This character excels in arenas with lots of walls and tight spaces where teleportation creates paths others can't access. In team battles, Shadow Ninja makes an excellent scout and flanker, teleporting behind enemy lines to attack from unexpected angles. Master players use his teleport defensively as well, escaping seemingly inescapable bomb traps at the last second. The trade-off for this mobility is that Shadow Ninja starts with only one bomb capacity, making power-ups that increase bomb count particularly valuable.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Robo-Bomber (Silver)</h5>
                        <p>New to Bomb It 7, Robo-Bomber brings a mechanical twist to the battlefield with his unique shield ability. When activated, his shield blocks one explosion completely, making him the only character who can survive a direct blast without any power-ups. This defensive capability comes at the cost of slightly reduced movement speed compared to other characters. Robo-Bomber starts with bombs that have extra destructive power against environmental objects, making him excellent at quickly clearing paths through breakable walls. His tankiness makes him ideal for aggressive, front-line play where taking risks can yield big rewards. In team battles, Robo-Bomber often leads the charge, absorbing damage while teammates follow behind. The shield has a cooldown period after use, so timing it perfectly is crucial – save it for when escape is impossible rather than using it at the first sign of danger.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Frost Queen (Blue)</h5>
                        <p>Another Bomb It 7 newcomer, Frost Queen introduces crowd control to the series with her freeze ability. When activated, she temporarily freezes all opponents within a small radius, rendering them immobile and vulnerable to well-placed bombs. While her starting bomb capacity and blast radius are average, she moves slightly faster than most characters. Frost Queen excels in crowded arenas where multiple opponents might be caught in her freeze effect simultaneously. Her ability synergizes perfectly with the bomb kick power-up, as she can freeze opponents and then kick bombs directly at them. In team battles, Frost Queen's freeze creates perfect setups for teammates to eliminate immobilized enemies. The freeze effect has a longer cooldown than most special abilities, making timing crucial – save it for when multiple opponents are nearby rather than using it on a single target. Players who enjoy tactical control and setting up perfect eliminations will love Frost Queen's playstyle.</p>

                        <p>Bomb It 7 brings several major improvements over earlier installments while maintaining the core gameplay that fans love. The biggest addition is character-specific abilities that completely change how each bomber plays – teleportation, shields, freezing opponents, and more create entirely new strategies. The game also features more interactive environments with hazards like moving platforms, conveyor belts, and destructible terrain that changes throughout matches. New power-ups like ghost bombs (which pass through soft walls) and bomb magnets (which attract nearby bombs) add fresh tactical options. Visually, the graphics have been upgraded with more detailed characters, smoother animations, and dynamic lighting effects that make explosions look more impressive. Game modes have expanded to include Team Battle and Survival in addition to the classic free-for-all. The AI has been significantly improved, with computer opponents that use actual strategies rather than random movements. There's also a new achievement system that rewards different playstyles and challenges you to try new approaches. Overall, Bomb It 7 is the most feature-complete and polished entry in the series while remaining true to what made the original games fun.</p>

                        <h5>Can I play Bomb It 7 with friends on the same computer?</h5>
                        <p>Absolutely! One of the best features of Bomb It 7 is its local multiplayer that supports up to four players on the same computer. To set this up, select "Multiplayer" or "Local Play" from the main menu, then choose how many players will join (2-4). Each player will select their character, and then you'll choose an arena for your battle. The default controls are: Player 1 uses arrow keys and spacebar, Player 2 uses WASD and F, Player 3 uses IJKL and H, and Player 4 uses TFGH and B. In most versions, you can customize these controls if needed through the options menu. For the best experience, consider connecting your computer to a larger monitor or TV and make sure your keyboard can handle multiple key presses simultaneously (some basic keyboards have limitations with this). If possible, using a combination of keyboard and USB controllers works even better, especially for 3-4 player matches. Local multiplayer matches can be customized with different time limits, item frequency, and starting power-ups, making it perfect for quick gaming sessions during lunch breaks or more extended competitions after school.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>What are the best power-ups to prioritize?</h5>
                        <p>While power-up priority partly depends on your character choice and playstyle, some power-ups consistently provide more value than others. The cornerstone power-ups that benefit almost every strategy are: Bomb Up (increases your bomb capacity), Fire Up (extends explosion radius), and Speed Up (improves movement speed). These three create the foundation of a strong build and should typically be your first priority. After securing these basics, look for these game-changing power-ups: Kick (allows you to push bombs), which dramatically increases your tactical options; Remote Detonator (lets you choose when bombs explode), which enables precise timing for traps; and Bomb Pass (lets you walk through your own bombs), which prevents self-trapping. Some character-specific recommendations: Shadow Ninja benefits enormously from Bomb Up to offset his starting single-bomb limitation; Robo-Bomber pairs well with Punch (which lets you hit bombs to send them flying) due to his frontal playstyle; Frost Queen becomes devastating with Kick since she can freeze opponents then kick bombs at them. Generally less useful power-ups include the Boxing Glove (which pushes opponents) and the limited-use power-ups that only affect a single bomb. Remember that in some arenas, certain power-ups become more valuable – like Wall Pass in maze-heavy levels or Skates on ice levels.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>How do I deal with opponents who camp in corners?</h5>
                        <p>Corner camping is a common defensive strategy in Bomb It games, but Bomb It 7 offers more counters to this tactic than previous versions. The most straightforward approach is using bombs with increased blast radius (Fire Up) to reach campers from a safe distance. If you've collected the Bomb Kick power-up, you can kick bombs directly into their corner without exposing yourself to danger. Several character abilities are perfect corner-camper counters: Shadow Ninja can teleport behind them, Frost Queen can freeze them from a distance, and characters with remote bombs can place a bomb near their corner and detonate it when they least expect it. The new Ghost Bomb power-up is particularly effective as its explosion passes through soft walls, hitting campers who think they're protected. On some maps, environmental features like teleporters or movable objects can provide access to otherwise safe corners. As a last resort, you can use the "waiting game" strategy – since corner campers aren't collecting power-ups, you can gather resources around the rest of the map and eventually overwhelm them with your superior capabilities. Remember that in timed matches, campers will eventually be forced to move as the playable area shrinks or hazards like rising lava appear.</p>

                    <div class="mb-3">
                        <h5>Does the game save my progress automatically?</h5>
                        <p>Yes! Bomb It 7 automatically saves your progress using your browser's local storage. This typically includes your unlocked characters, completed achievements, and game settings preferences. The game saves automatically after completing matches, unlocking new content, or changing settings. This means you can close the game and return later to find your progress intact. However, if you're playing on a school or public computer, be aware that your progress might be reset if the browser data is cleared between sessions. For the most reliable experience, consider playing on a personal device where your browser data won't be regularly wiped. Some versions of Bomb It 7 include profile features where you can create a username that helps track your stats across sessions. In-game progress during a match is never saved – if you leave during a battle, you'll need to start a new match when you return. If you're particularly proud of your achievements or character unlocks, it's a good idea to complete gaming sessions rather than leaving mid-progress, especially on shared computers where data retention isn't guaranteed.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center mb-4">Why Bomb It 7 Is So Addictive</h4>
                    <p>Bomb It 7 hits that perfect sweet spot of being incredibly easy to learn but offering endless depth for those who want to master it. The basic concept – move around, drop bombs, don't get blown up – is so intuitive that anyone can grasp it within seconds. Yet beneath this simple exterior lies a game of surprising strategic complexity, especially with the addition of character-specific abilities and interactive environments. This accessibility combined with depth creates an experience that remains fresh and challenging even after hundreds of matches.</p>
                    
                    <p>The game's short match duration is perfectly calibrated for the school environment. Most battles wrap up in 2-3 minutes, making them ideal for quick gaming sessions during breaks or lunch periods. This bite-sized format encourages the "just one more round" mentality, as there's always time to squeeze in another match. The rapid restart after defeat minimizes downtime and keeps the action flowing continuously.</p>
                    
                    <p>The chaotic unpredictability of matches ensures no two games play out the same way. The combination of multiple players, environmental hazards, power-up spawns, and character abilities creates nearly endless permutations of gameplay scenarios. Even when you're on the verge of elimination, a well-timed special ability or lucky power-up can completely reverse your fortunes, creating those memorable comeback moments that keep players engaged and excited.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most importantly, Bomb It 7 shines brightest as a social experience. The local multiplayer mode transforms it from a simple game into a friendship-testing competitive arena filled with shouts of triumph, groans of defeat, and constant trash talk. There's something uniquely satisfying about eliminating your friends with a perfectly placed bomb and seeing their real-time reactions right next to you. These shared gaming moments – the narrow escapes, the epic fails, the last-second victories – create bonds and memories that extend well beyond the game itself, cementing Bomb It 7's status as an essential title for any gaming session with friends.</p>
